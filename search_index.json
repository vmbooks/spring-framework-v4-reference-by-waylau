Overview of Spring Framework/2.2. Modules.html":{"url":"I. Overview of Spring Framework/2.2. Modules.html","title":"模块","keywords":"","body":"模块\nSpring Framework 的功能被组织成了 20 来个模块。这些模块分成  Core Container, Data Access/Integration, Web, AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), Instrumentation, Messaging, 和 Test，如下图：\nFigure 2.1. Overview of the Spring Framework\n\n下面章节会列出可用的模块，名称与功能及他们的主题相关。组件名称与组件的 ID 相关，用于2.3.1节中的依赖管理工具。\n核心容器\nCore Container 由 spring-core, spring-beans, spring-context, spring-context-support, 和 spring-expression (Spring Expression Language) 模块组成。\nspring-core 和 spring-beans 提供框架的基础部分，包括 IoC 和 Dependency Injection 功能。BeanFactory 是一个复杂的工厂模式的实现。不需要可以编程的单例，并允许您将配置和特定的依赖从你的实际程序逻辑中解耦。\nContext (spring-context) 模块建立且提供于在Core 和 Beans 模块的基础上，它是一种在框架类型下实现对象存储操作的手段，有一点像 JNDI 注册。Context 继承了 Beans 模块的特性，并且增加了对国际化的支持（例如用在资源包中）、事件广播、资源加载和创建上下文（例如 一个 Servlet 容器）。Context 模块也支持例如 EJB，JMX 和基础远程这样的 JavaEE 特性。ApplicationContext 是 Context 模块的焦点。spring-context-support 提供对常见第三方库的支持集成进 Spring 应用上下文，如缓存 (EhCache, Guava, JCache), 通信 (JavaMail), 调度 (CommonJ, Quartz) 和 模板引擎 (FreeMarker, JasperReports, Velocity)。\nspring-expression 模块提供了一个强大的Expression Language（表达式语言）用来在运行时查询和操作对象图。这是作为JSP2.1 规范所指定的统一表达式语言（unified EL）的一种延续。这种语言支持对属性值、属性参数、方法调用、数组内容存储、收集器和索引、逻辑和算数操作及命名变量，并且通过名称从 Spring 的控制反转容器中取回对象。表达式语言模块也支持  List 的映射和选择，正如像常见的列表汇总一样。\nAOP 及 Instrumentation\nspring-aop 模块提供 AOP Alliance-compliant（联盟兼容）的面向切面编程实现，允许你自定义，比如，方法拦截器和切入点完全分离代码。使用源码级别元数据的功能，你也可以在你的代码中加入 behavioral information (行为信息)，在某种程度上类似于 .NET 属性。\n单独的 spring-aspects 模块提供了集成使用 AspectJ。\nspring-instrument 模块提供了类 instrumentation 的支持和在某些应用程序服务器使用类加载器实现。spring-instrument-tomcat 用于 Tomcat Instrumentation 代理。\n消息\nSpring Framework 4 包含了 spring-messaging 模块，从 Spring 集成项目中抽象出来，比如  Message, MessageChannel, MessageHandler 及其他用来提供基于消息的基础服务。该模块还包括一组消息映射方法的注解，类似于基于编程模型 Spring MVC 的注解。\n数据访问/集成\nData Access/Integration 层由 JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS, 和 Transaction 模块组成。\nspring-jdbc 模块提供了不需要编写冗长的JDBC代码和解析数据库厂商特有的错误代码的JDBC-抽象层。\nspring-tx 模块的支持可编程和声明式事务管理，用于实现了特殊的接口的和你所有的POJO类（Plain Old Java Objects）。\nspring-orm 模块提供了流行的 object-relational mapping（对象-关系映射）API集成层，其包含 JPA，JDO，Hibernate。使用ORM包，你可以使用所有的 O/R 映射框架结合所有Spring 提供的特性，比如前面提到的简单声明式事务管理功能。\nspring-oxm 模块提供抽象层用于支持  Object/XML mapping （对象/XML映射）的实现,如 JAXB、Castor、XMLBeans、JiBX 和 XStream 等。\nspring-jms 模块（Java Messaging Service）包含生产和消费信息的功能。 从 Spring Framework 4.1 开始提供集成 spring-messaging  模块。\n2.2.5 Web\nWeb 层由 spring-web, spring-webmvc, spring-websocket, 和 spring-webmvc-portlet 组成 。\nspring-web 模块提供了基本的面向 web 开发的集成功能，例如多方文件上传、使用 Servlet listeners 和 Web 开发应用程序上下文初始化 IoC 容器。它也包含 HTTP 客户端以及 Spring 远程访问的支持的 web 相关的部分。\nspring-webmvc 模块（也被称为 Web Servlet 模块）包含 Spring 的model-view-controller （模型-视图-控制器（MVC）和  REST Web Services 实现的Web应用程序。Spring 的 MVC 框架提供了domain model（领域模型）代码和 web form (网页) 之间的完全分离，并且集成了  Spring Framework 所有的其他功能。\nspring-webmvc-portlet 模块（也被称为 Web-Portlet 模块）提供了MVC 模式的实现是用一个 Portlet 的环境和 spring-webmvc 模块功能的镜像。\n2.2.6 Test\nspring-test 模块支持通过组合 JUnit 或 TestNG 来进行单元测试和集成测试 。它提供了连续的加载 ApplicationContext 并且缓存这些上下文。它还提供了  mock object（模仿对象），您可以使用隔离测试你的代码。\n"},"I. Overview of Spring Framework/2.3. Usage scenarios.html":{"url":"I. Overview of Spring Framework/2.3. Usage scenarios.html","title":"使用场景","keywords":"","body":"使用场景\n前面的构建模块描述在很多的情况下使 Spring 是一个合理的选择，从资源受限的嵌入式程序到成熟的企业应用程序都可以使用 Spring 事务管理功能和 web 框架集成。\nFigure 2.2. Typical full-fledged Spring web application\n\nSpring 声明式事务管理特性使 Web 应用程序拥有完全的事务，就像你使用 EJB 容器管理的事务。所有的自定义业务逻辑可以用简单的 POJO 实现，用 Spring 的 IoC 容器进行管理。额外的服务包括发送电子邮件和验证，是独立的网络层的支持，它可以让你选择在何处执行验证规则。Spring 的 ORM 支持集成 JPA，Hibernate，JDO；例如，当使用 Hibernate，您可以继续使用现有的映射文件和 标准的 Hibernate 的 SessionFactory 配置。表单控制器将 Web 层和领域模型无缝集成，消除 ActionForms 或其他类用于变换 HTTP 参数成为您的域模型值的需要。\nFigure 2.3. Spring middle-tier using a third-party web framework\n\n有时，不允许你完全切换到一个不同的框架。Spring Framework 不强制使用它,它不是一个全有或全无的解决方案。现有的前端 Struts, Tapestry, JSF 或其他 UI 框架，可以集成一个基于 Spring 中间件，它允许你使用 Spring 事务的功能。你只需要将业务逻辑连接使用 ApplicationContext 和使用WebApplicationContext 集成到你的 web 层。\nFigure 2.4. Remoting usage scenario\n\n当你需要通过 web 服务访问现有代码时，可以使用 Spring 的 Hessian-, Burlap-, Rmi- 或 JaxRpcProxyFactory 类。启用远程访问现有的应用程序并不难。\nFigure 2.5. EJBs - Wrapping existing POJOs\n\nSpring Framework 也提供了 Enterprise JavaBeans 访问和抽象层 使你能重用现有的 POJOs,并且在需要声明安全的时候打包他们成为无状态的 bean 用于可伸缩，安全的 web 应用里。\n依赖关系管理和命名约定\n依赖管理和依赖注入是不同的概念。为了让 Spring 的这些不错的功能运用到运用程序中（比如依赖注入），你需要收集所有的需要的库（JAR文件），并且在编译、运行的时候将它们放到你的类路径中。这些依赖不是虚拟组件的注入，而是物理的资源在文件系统中（通常）。依赖管理过程包括定位这些资源，存储它们并添加它们到类路径。依赖可以是直接（如我的应用程序运行时依赖于 Spring ），或者是间接（如我的应用程序依赖 commons-dbcp ，而 commons-dbcp 又依赖于 commons-pool）。间接的依赖也被称为 “transitive （传递）”，它是最难识别和管理的依赖。\n如果你将使用 Spring，你需要复制哪些包含你需要的 Spring 功能的 jar包。为了使这个过程更加简单，Spring 被打包为一组模块，这些模块尽可能多的分开依赖关系。例如，如果不想写一个 web 应用程序，你就不需要引入 Spring-web 模块。为了在本指南中标记 Spring 库模块我们使用了速记命名约定 spring- 或者 spring-.jar ，其中*代表模块的短名（比如 spring-core,spring-webmvc, spring-jms 等）。实际的jar 文件的名字，通常是用模块名字和版本号级联（如 spring-core-4.3.0.RELEASE.jar）\n每个 Spring Framework 发行版本将会放到下面的位置：\n\nMaven Central （Maven 中央库），这是 Maven 查询的默认库，而不需要任何特殊的配置就能使用。许多常用的 Spring 的依赖库也存在与Maven Central ，并且 Spring 社区的很大一部分都使用 Maven 进行依赖管理，所以这是最方便他们的。jar 命名格式是 spring-*-.jar ， Maven groupId  是 org.springframework\n公共 Maven 仓库还拥有 Spring 专有的库。除了最终的 GA 版本，这个库还保存开发的快照和里程碑。JAR 文件的名字是和 Maven Central 相同的形式，所以这是让 Spring 的开发版本使用其它部署在  Maven Central 库的一个有用的地方。该库还包含一个用于发布的 zip 文件包含所有Spring jar，方便下载。\n\n所以首先，你要决定用什么方式管理你的依赖，通常建议你使用自动系统像 Maven, Gradle 或 Ivy, 当然你也可以下载 jar\n下面是 Spring 中的组件列表。更多描述，详见2.2.

SockJS implementations, including STOMP support\n\nSpring 的依赖以及基于 Spring\n虽然 Spring 提供了集成在一个大范围的企业和其他外部工具的支持，它故意保持其强制性依赖关系降到最低：在简单的用例里，你无需查找并下载（甚至自动）一大批 jar 库来使用 Spring 。基本的依赖注入只有一个外部强制性的依赖，这是用来做日志的（见下面更详细地描述日志选项）。\n接下来我们将一步步展示如果配置依赖 Spring 的程序，首先用 Maven 然后用 Gradle 和最后用 Ivy。在所有的情况下，如果有不清楚的地方，查看的依赖性管理系统的文档，或看一些示例代码。Spring 本身是使用 Gradle 来管理依赖的，我们的很多示例也是使用 Gradle 或 Maven。\n译者注：有关 Gradle 的使用，可以参见笔者的另外一部作品《Gradle 2 用户指南》\nMaven 依赖管理\n如果您使用的是 Maven 的依赖管理你甚至不需要明确提供日志依赖。例如，要创建一个应用程序的上下文和使用依赖注入来配置应用程序，你的Maven 依赖将看起来像这样：\n\n    \n        org.springframework\n        spring-context\n        4.3.0.RELEASE\n        runtime\n    \n\n就是它。注意 scope 可声明为 runtime （运行时）如果你不需要编译 Spring 的API，这通常是基本的依赖注入使用的案例。\n以上与 Maven Central 存储库工程实例。使用  Spring Maven 存储库（如里程碑或开发者快照），你需要在你的 Maven 配置指定的存储位置。如下：\n\n    \n        io.spring.repo.maven.release\n        http://repo.spring.io/release/\n        false\n    \n\n里程碑：\n\n    \n        io.spring.repo.maven.milestone\n        http://repo.spring.io/milestone/\n        false\n    \n\n以及快照：\n\n    \n        io.spring.repo.maven.snapshot\n        http://repo.spring.io/snapshot/\n        true\n    \n\nMaven \"Bill Of Materials\" 依赖\n有可能不小心使用不同版本的 Spring JAR 在使用 Maven 时。例如，你可能发现一个第三方的库，或另一 Spring 的项目，拉取了一个在传递依赖较早的发布包。如果你自己忘记了显式声明一个直接依赖，各种意想不到的问题出现。\n为了克服这些问题，Maven 支持 \"bill of materials\" (BOM) 的依赖的概念。你可以在你的 dependencyManagement 部分引入 spring-framework-bom 来确保所有 spring依赖（包括直接和传递的）是同一版本。\n\n    \n        \n            org.springframework\n            spring-framework-bom\n            4.3.0.RELEASE\n            pom\n            import\n        \n    \n\n使用 BOM 后，当依赖 Spring Framework 组件后，无需指定 属性\n\n    \n        org.springframework\n        spring-context\n    \n    \n        org.springframework\n        spring-web\n    \n\nGradle 依赖管理\n用 Gradle 来使用 Spring ,在 repositories 中填入适当的 URL :\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n    // and optionally...\n    maven { url \"http://repo.spring.io/release\" }\n}\n可以适当修改 URL 从 /release 到 /milestone 或 /snapshot 。库一旦配置，就能声明 Gradle 依赖:\ndependencies {\n    compile(\"org.springframework:spring-context:4.3.0.RELEASE\")\n    testCompile(\"org.springframework:spring-test:4.3.0.RELEASE\")\n}\nIvy 依赖管理\n如果你更喜欢用Ivy管理依赖也有类似的配置选项。\n配置 Ivy ，将指向 Spring 的库 添加下面的 resolver（解析器）到你ivysettings.xml：\n\n    \n\n可以适当修改 root URL 从 /release 到 /milestone 或 /snapshot 。\n一旦配置，就能添加依赖，举例 (在 ivy.xml):\nruntime\"/>\n分发的 zip 文件\n虽然使用构建系统，支持依赖管理是推荐的方式获得了 Spring Framework,，它仍然是可下载分发的 zip 文件。\n分发的 zip 文件是发布到 Spring Maven Repository （这是为了我们的便利，在下载这些文件的时候你不需要 Maven 或者其他的构建系统）。\n下载一个 Zip，在web 浏览器打开 http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring ，选择适当的文件夹的版本。下载完毕文件结尾是 -dist.zip，例如， spring-framework-{spring-version}-RELEASE-dist.zip 。分发也支持发布里程碑和快照。\n日志\n对于 Spring 日志是非常重要的依赖，因为：a）它是唯一的外部强制性的依赖；b）每个人都喜欢从他们使用的工具看到一些输出；c）Spring 结合很多其他工具都选择了日志依赖。应用开发者的一个目标就是往往是有统一的日志配置在一个中心位置为了整个应用程序，包括所有的外部元件。这就更加困难，因为它可能已经有太多选择的日志框架。\n在 Spring 强制性的日志依赖 是 Jakarta Commons Logging API（JCL）。我们编译 JCL，我们也使得 JCL Log对象对 Spring Framework 的扩展类可见。所有版本的 Spring 使用同样的日志库，这对于用户来说是很重要的：迁移就会变得容易向后兼容性，即使扩展 Spring的应用程序。我们这样做是为了使 Spring 的模块之一明确依赖 commons-logging (JCL的典型实现)，然后使得其他的所有模块在编译的时候都依赖它。使用 Maven 为例，如果你想知道何处依赖了 commons-logging ，那么就是来自 Spring 的并且明确来自中心模块 spring-core。\n关于 commons-logging 的好处是你不需要任何东西就能让你的应用程序程序跑起来。它有一个运行时发现算法，该算法在众所周知的classpath路径下寻找其他的日志框架并且使用它认为适合的（或者你可以告诉它你需要的是哪一个）。如果没有其他的日志框架存在，你可以从JDK（Java.util.logging 或者JUL 的简称）获得日志。在大多数情况下，你可以在控制台查看你的Spring 应用程序工作和日志，并且这是很重要的。\n不使用 Commons Logging\n不幸的是，commons-logging 的运行时日志框架发现算法，确实方便了最终用户,但却是有问题的。如果我们能够时光倒流，现在从新开始 Spring 项目并且他使用了不同的日志依赖。第一个选择很可能是Simple Logging Facade for Java ( SLF4J)，过去也曾被许多其他工具通过 Spring 使用到他们的应用程序。\n主要有两种方法可以关闭commons-logging：\n\n通过 spring-core 模块排除依赖（因为它是唯一的显示依赖于 commons-logging 的模块）。\n依赖特殊的 commons-logging 依赖，用空的jar（更多的细节可以在SLF4J FAQ中找到）替换掉库。\n\n排除 commons-logging，添加以下的内容到 dependencyManagement 部分：\n\n    \n        org.springframework\n        spring-core\n        4.3.0.RELEASE\n        \n            \n                commons-logging\n                commons-logging\n            \n        \n    \n\n现在，这个应用程序可能运行不了，因为在类路径上没有实现 JCL API，因此要修复它就必须提供一个新的(日志框架)。在下一节我们将向你展示如何提供另一种实现 JCL，使用 SLF4J 作为例子的另一种实现。\n使用 SLF4J\nSLF4J 是一个更加简洁的依赖，在运行时相对于 commons-logging 更加的有效因为它使用编译时绑定来代替运行时发现其他日志框架的集成。这也意味着，你不得不更加明确你想在运行时发生什么，并相应的声明它或者配置它。SLF4J 提供绑定很多的常见日志框架，因此你可以选择一个你已经使用的，并且绑定到配置和管理。\nSLF4J 提供了绑定很多的常见日志框架，包括 JCL，它也做了反向工作:是其他日志框架和它自己之间的桥梁。因此在 Spring 中使用 SLF4J 时，你需要使用 SLF4J-JCL 桥接替换掉 commons-logging 的依赖。一旦你这么做了，Spring 调用日志就会调用 SLF4J API，因此如果在你的应用程序中的其他库使用这个API，那么你就需要有个地方配置和管理日志。\n一个常见的选择就是桥接 Spring 和 SLF4J，提供显示的绑定 SLF4J 到Log4J 上。你需要支持 4 个的依赖（排除现有的 commons-logging）：桥接，SLF4J API，绑定 Log4J 和 Log4J 实现自身。在 Maven 中你可以这样做：\n\n    \n        org.springframework\n        spring-core\n        4.3.0.RELEASE\n        \n            \n                commons-logging\n                commons-logging\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        org.slf4j\n        jcl-over-slf4j\n        1.5.8\n    \n    \n        org.slf4j\n        slf4j-api\n        1.5.8\n    \n    \n        org.slf4j\n        slf4j-log4j12\n        1.5.8\n    \n    \n        log4j\n        log4j\n        1.2.14\n    \n\n这似乎是一个很大的依赖性，其仅仅是为了得到一些日志文件。它的确如此，但它是可选的，它在关于类加载器的问题上应该比 commons-logging 表现的更加的好，特别是当它运行在在一个严格的容器中像OSGi 平台。据说还有一个性能优势是因为绑定是在编译时而不是在运行时。\n对于SLF4J用户来说，一个更常见的选择是，使用更少的步骤和产生更少的依赖，那就是直接绑定 Logback。这消除了多余的绑定步骤，因为 Logback 直接实现了 SLF4J，因此你只需要依赖两个库而不是4个（jcl-over-slf4j 和 logback）。如果你这样做，你可能还需要从其他外部依赖（不是 Spring）排除 slf4j-api 依赖，因为在类路径中你只需要一个版本的API。\n使用 Log4J\n许多人使用 Log4j 作为日志框架，用于配置和管理的目的。它是有效的和完善的，事实上这也是我们在运行时使用的，当我们构架和测试 Spring 时。Spring 也提供一些配置和初始化 Log4j 的工具，因此在某些模块上它有一个可选的编译时依赖在 Log4j。\n为了使 Log4j 工作在默认的 JCL 依赖下（commons-logging），你所需要做的就是把 Log4j 放到类路径下，为它提供配置文件(log4j.properties 或者 log4j.xml 在类路径的根目录下)。因此对于Maven 用户这就是你的依赖声明：\n\n    \n        org.springframework\n        spring-core\n        4.3.0.RELEASE\n    \n    \n        log4j\n        log4j\n        1.2.14\n    \n\n下面是一个 log4j.properties 的实例，用于将日志打印到控制台：\nlog4j.rootCategory=INFO, stdout\n\nlog4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ABSOLUTE} %5p %t %c{2}:%L - %m%n\n\nlog4j.category.org.springframework.beans.factory=DEBUG\nRuntime Containers with Native JCL\n很多的人在提供 JCL 实现的容器下运行他们的 Spring 应用程序。IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS)为例。这样往往会导致问题，遗憾的是没有一个一劳永逸的解决方案；仅仅简单地排除 commons-logging依赖在大多数情况下是不够的。\n要清楚这一点：问题报告通常不是 JCL 本身，或者 commons-logging：相反，他们是绑定 commons-logging 到其他的框架（通常是 Log4j ）。这可能会失败，因为commons-logging改变了路径，当他们运行时发现在一些容器中找到了老版本（1.0）并且现在大多数人使用的现代版本(1.1)。Spring 不使用 JCL API 任何不常见的模块，所以没有什么问题出现，但是很快 Spring 或者你的应用程序视图做一些日志时，你会发现绑定的 Log4j 不工作了。\n在这种情况下，WAS 最容易的是转化类加载器的层次结构（IBM 称之为“parent last”），使应用程序控制 JCL 的依赖关系，而不是容器。该选项不是总是开放的，但是有很多其他的建议在公共领域的替代方法，你的里程可能取决于确切的版本和特定的容器。\n"},"II.

The Spring IoC container\n\n配置元数据\n如上述图所示，Spring IoC 容器使用 配置元数据（ configuration metadata）;这个配置元数据代表了应用程序开发人员告诉 Spring 容器在应用程序中如何来实例化，配置和组装对象。\n传统的配置元数据是一个简单而直观的 XML 格式，这是大多数本章用来传达关键概念和 Spring IoC 容器的功能。\n基于 XML 的元数据并不是配置元数据的唯一允许的形式。 Spring IoC容器本身是完全与配置元数据的实际写入格式分离的。现在，许多开发人员选择基于 Java 的配置。来开发他们的应用程序\n更多其他格式的元数据见：\n\n基于注解的配置：Spring 2.5 的推出了基于注解的配置元数据支持。\n基于Java的配置：Spring3.0 开始，由 Spring JavaConfig 项目提供了很多功能成为核心 Spring 框架的一部分。因此，你可以通过使用Java，而不是 XML 文件中定义外部 bean 到你的应用程序类。要使用这些新功能，请参阅 @Configuration，@Bean，@Import 和 @DependsOn 注解。\n\nSpring 配置至少一个，通常不止一个 bean 由容器来管理。基于 XML 的配置元数据将这些 bean 配置为元素，并放置到 元素内部。 Java 配置通常在 @Configuration注解的类中使用 @Bean 注解到方法上。\n这些 bean 定义对应于构成应用程序的实际对象。通常，您定义服务层对象，数据访问对象（DAO），展示对象，如 Struts Action 的情况下，基础设施的对象，如 Hibernate 的 SessionFactories，JMS Queues，等等。通常一个不配置细粒度域对象在容器中，因为它通常负责 DAO 和业务逻辑来创建和负载域对象。但是，你可以使用 Spring 和 AspectJ的集成配置在 IoC 容器的控制之外创建的对象。请参阅使用 AspectJ 在 Spring 中进行依赖关系注入域对象。\n以下示例显示基于 XML 的配置元数据的基本结构：\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\nid 属性是一个字符串，唯一识别一个独立的 bean 定义。class 属性定义了 bean 的类型，并使用完整的类名。 id 属性的值是指协作对象。将XML 用于参照协作对象未在本例中示出;请参阅 依赖以获取更多信息。\n实例化容器\n实例化 Spring IoC 容器是直截了当的。提供给 ApplicationContext构造器的路径就是实际的资源字符串，使容器装入从各种外部资源的配置元数据，如本地文件系统， Java CLASSPATH，等等。\nApplicationContext context =\n    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[] {\"services.xml\", \"daos.xml\"});\n当你了解 Spring 的 IoC 容器，你可能想知道更多关于 Spring 的Resource 抽象，如第7章，资源，它提供了一种方便的从一个 URI 语法定义的位置读取一个InputStream 描述。特别地，资源路径被用作构建应用程序的上下文，详见第7.7节，“应用环境和资源的路径”。\n下面的例子显示了服务层对象（services.xml中）配置文件：\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n下面的例子显示了数据访问对象 daos.xml 文件：\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n在上面的例子中，服务层由类 PetStoreServiceImpl，以及类型的两个数据访问对象 JpaAccountDao 和 JpaItemDao（基于JPA对象/关系映射标准）组成。property name 元素是指 JavaBean 属性的名称，而 ref 元素引用另一个 bean 定义的名称。 id 和 ref 元素之间的这种联系表达了合作对象之间的依赖关系。对于配置对象的依赖关系的详细信息，请参阅依赖。\n撰写基于XML的配置元数据\n它可以让 bean 定义跨越多个 XML 文件,这样做非常有用。通常，每个单独的 XML 配置文件代表你的架构一个逻辑层或模块。\n您可以使用应用程序上下文构造从所有这些 XML 片段加载 bean 定义。这个构造函数的多个 Resource 位置，作为上一节中被证明。另外，使用  元素的一个或多个出现，从另一个或多个文件加载 bean 定义。 例如：\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n上面的例子中，使用了3个文件：services.xml，messageSource.xml 及 themeSource.xml来加载外部 bean 定义。所有位置路径是相对于导入文件的，因此 services.xml 是必须和导入文件在同一目录或类路径中的位置，而 messageSource.xml 和 themeSource.xml 来必须在导入文件的 resources 以下位置。正如你所看到的，前面的斜线被忽略，但考虑到这些路径是相对的，它更好的形式是不使用斜线。该文件的内容被导入，包括顶级元素，必须根据  Spring Schema 是有效的XML bean 定义。\n这是可能的，但不推荐，引用在使用相对“../”的路径的父目录中的文件。这样将创建一个文件，该文件是当前应用程序之外的依赖。特别是，该引用不推荐“classpath：” URL（例如，“classpath:../services.xml”），在运行时解决过程中选择了“就近”的类路径的根，然后查找到它的父目录。类路径配置的变化可能导致不同的，不正确的目录的选择。\n您可以随时使用完全合格的资源位置，而不是相对路径：例如，file:C:/config/services.xml\" 或 \"classpath:/config/services.xml\"。但是，要知道，你这是是在耦合应用程序的配置到特定的绝对位置。通常优选间接的方式应对这种绝对路径，例如，通过“${…​}”在运行时解决了对JVM系统属性占位符。\n使用容器\nApplicationContext 是能够保持 bean 定义以及相互依赖关系的高级工厂接口。使用方法 T getBean(String name, Class requiredType)就可以取得 bean 的实例。\nApplicationContext 中可以读取 bean 定义并访问它们，如下所示：\n// create and configure beans\nApplicationContext context =\n    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[] {\"services.xml\", \"daos.xml\"});\n\n// retrieve configured instance\nPetStoreService service = context.getBean(\"petStore\", PetStoreService.class);\n\n// use configured instance\nList userList = service.getUsernameList();\n您可以使用 getBean() 方法来获取 bean 的实例。 ApplicationContext 接口有一些其他的方法来获取 bean，但理想的应用程序代码不应该使用它们。事实上，你的应用程序代码不应该调用的getBean() 方法，因此在 Spring 的 API 没有依赖性的。例如，Spring如何与Web框架的集成提供了依赖注入各种Web框架类，如控制器和 JSF 管理的bean。\n"},"III.

Core Technologies/Dependencies.html","title":"依赖","keywords":"","body":"Dependencies\n一般情况下企业应用不会只有一个对象（或者是Spring Bean）。甚至最简单的应用都要多个对象来协同工作来让终端用户看到一个完整的应用的。下一部分将解释开发者如何从仅仅定义单独的Bean，到让这些Bean在一个应用中协同工作。\nDependency Injection\n依赖注入是一个让对象只通过构造参数，工厂方法的参数或者配置的属性来定义他们的依赖的过程。这些依赖也是对象所需要协同工作的对象。容器会在创建Bean的时候注入这些依赖。整个过程完全反转了由Bean自己控制实例化或者引用依赖，所以这个过程也称之为控制反转。\n当使用了依赖注入的准则以后，会更易于管理和解耦对象之间的依赖，使得代码更加的简单。对象不再关注依赖，也不需要知道依赖类的位置。这样的话，开发者的类更加易于测试，尤其是当开发者的依赖是接口或者抽象类的情况，开发者可以轻易在单元测试中mock对象。\n依赖注入主要使用两种方式，一种是基于构造函数的注入，另一种的基于Setter方法的依赖注入。\nConstructor-based dependency Injection\n基于构造函数的依赖注入是由IoC容器来调用类的构造函数，构造函数的参数代表这个Bean所依赖的对象。跟调用带参数的静态工厂方法基本一样。下面的例子展示了一个类通过构造函数来实现依赖注入的。需要注意的是，这个类没有任何特殊的地方，只是一个简单的，不依赖于任何容器特殊接口，基类或者注解的普通类。\npublic class SimpleMovieLister {\n\n    // the SimpleMovieLister has a dependency on a MovieFinder\n    private MovieFinder movieFinder;\n\n    // a constructor so that the Spring container can inject a MovieFinder\n    public SimpleMovieLister(MovieFinder movieFinder) {\n        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;\n    }\n\n    // business logic that actually uses the injected MovieFinder is omitted...\n\n}\n构造函数的参数解析\n构造函数的参数解析是通过参数的类型来匹配的。如果在Bean的构造函数参数不存在歧义，那么构造器参数的顺序也就是就是这些参数实例化以及装载的顺序。参考如下代码：\npackage x.y;\n\npublic class Foo {\n\n    public Foo(Bar bar, Baz baz) {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n}\n假设Bar和Baz在继承层次上不相关，也没有什么歧义的话，下面的配置完全可以工作正常，开发者不需要再去元素中指定构造函数参数的索引或类型信息。\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n当引用另一个Bean的时候，如果类型确定的话，匹配会工作正常（如上面的例子）.当使用简单的类型的时候，比如说true，Spring IoC容器是无法判断值的类型的，所以是无法匹配的。考虑代码如下：\npackage examples;\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    // Number of years to calculate the Ultimate Answer\n    private int years;\n\n    // The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything\n    private String ultimateAnswer;\n\n    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {\n        this.years = years;\n        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;\n    }\n\n}\n在上面代码这种情况下，容器可以通过使用构造函数参数的type属性来实现简单类型的匹配。比如：\n\n    \n    \n\n或者使用index属性来指定构造参数的位置，比如：\n\n    \n    \n\n这个索引也同时是为了解决构造函数中有多个相同类型的参数无法精确匹配的问题。需要注意的是，索引是基于0开始的。\n开发者也可以通过参数的名称来去除二义性。\n\n    \n    \n\n需要注意的是,做这项工作的代码必须启用了调试标记编译,这样Spring才可以从构造函数查找参数名称。开发者也可以使用@ConstructorProperties注解来显式声明构造函数的名称，比如如下代码：\npackage examples;\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    // Fields omitted\n\n    @ConstructorProperties({\"years\", \"ultimateAnswer\"})\n    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {\n        this.years = years;\n        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;\n    }\n\n}\nSetter-based dependency injection\n基于Setter函数的依赖注入则是容器会调用Bean的无参构造函数，或者无参数的工厂方法，然后再来调用Setter方法来实现的依赖注入。\n下面的例子展示了使用Setter方法进行的依赖注入，下面的类对象只是简单的POJO对象，不依赖于任何Spring的特殊的接口，基类或者注解。\npublic class SimpleMovieLister {\n\n    // the SimpleMovieLister has a dependency on the MovieFinder\n    private MovieFinder movieFinder;\n\n    // a setter method so that the Spring container can inject a MovieFinder\n    public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {\n        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;\n    }\n\n    // business logic that actually uses the injected MovieFinder is omitted...\n\n}\nApplicationContext所管理Bean对于基于构造函数的依赖注入，或者基于Setter方式的依赖注入都是支持的。同时也支持使用Setter方式在通过构造函数注入依赖之后再次注入依赖。开发者在BeanDefinition中可以使用PropertyEditor实例来自由选择注入的方式。然而，大多数的开发者并不直接使用这些类，而是跟喜欢XML形式的bean定义，或者基于注解的组件（比如使用@Component，@Controller等）或者在配置了@Configuration的类上面使用@Bean的方法。\n\n基于构造函数还是基于Setter方法？\n因为开发者可以混用两者，所以通常比较好的方式是通过构造函数注入必要的依赖通过Setter方式来注入一些可选的依赖。其中，在Setter方法上面的@Required注解可用来构造必要的依赖。\nSpring队伍推荐基于构造函数的注入，因为这种方式会促使开发者将组件开发成不可变对象而且确保了注入的依赖不为null。而且，基于构造函数的注入的组件被客户端调用的时候也是完全构造好的。当然，从另一方面来说，过多的构造函数参数也是非常差的代码方式，这种方式说明类貌似有了太多的功能，最好重构将不同职能分离。\n基于Setter的注入只是用于可选的依赖，但是也最好配置一些合理的默认值。否则，需要对代码的依赖进行非NULL的检查了。基于Setter方法的注入有一个便利之处在于这种方式的注入是可以进行重配置和重新注入的。\n依赖注入的两种风格适合大多数的情况，但是有时使用第三方的库的时候，开发者可能并没有源码，而第三方的代码也没有setter方法，那么就只能使用基于构造函数的依赖注入了。\n\nDependency resolution process\n容器对Bean的解析如下：\n\n创建并根据描述的元数据来实例化ApplicationContext。配置元数据可以通过XML， Java 代码，或者注解。\n每一个Bean的依赖通过构造函数参数或者属性或者静态工厂方法的参数等来表示。这些依赖会在Bean创建的的时候注入和装载。\n每一个属性或者构造函数的参数都是实际定义的值或者引用容器中其他的Bean。\n每一个属性或者构造参数可以根据其指定的类型转换而成。Spring也可以将String转成默认的Java内在的类型，比如int,long,String,boolean等。\n\nSpring容器会在容器创建的时候针对每一个Bean进行校验。然而，Bean的属性在Bean没有真正创建的时候是不会配置进去的。单例类型的Bean是容器创建的时候配置成预实例状态的。Bean的Scope在后续有介绍。其他的Bean都只有在请求的时候，才会创建。显然创建Bean对象会有一个依赖的图。这个图表示Bean之间的依赖关系，容器根据此来决定创建和配置Bean的顺序。\n\n循环依赖\n如果开发者主要使用基于构造函数的依赖注入，那么很有可能出现一个循环依赖的场景。\n比如说：类A在构造函数中依赖于类B的实例，而类B的构造函数依赖类A的实例。如果你这么配置类A和类B相互注入的话，Spring IoC容器会发现这个运行时的循环依赖，并且抛出BeanCurrentlyInCreationException。\n开发者可以通过使用Setter方法来配置依赖注入，这样可以解决这个问题。或者就不使用基于构造函数的依赖注入，仅仅使用基于Setter方法的依赖注入。换言之，尽管不推荐，但是开发者可以将循环依赖配置为基于Setter方法的依赖注入。\n\n开发者可以相信Spring能正确处理Bean。Spring能够在加载的过程中发现配置的问题，比如引用到不存在的Bean或者是循环依赖。Spring会尽可能晚的在Bean创建的时候装载属性或者解析依赖。这也意味着Spring容器加载正确后会在Bean注入依赖出错的时候抛出异常。比如，Bean抛出缺少属性或者属性不合法。这延迟的解析也是为什么ApplicationContext的实现会令单例Bean处于预实例化状态。这样，通过ApplicationContext的创建，可以在真正使用Bean之前消耗一些内存代价发现配置的问题。开发者也可以覆盖默认的行为让单例Bean延迟加载，而不是处于预实例化状态。\n如果不存在循环依赖的话，Bean所引用的依赖会优先完全构造依赖的。举例来说，如果Bean A依赖于Bean B，那么Spring IoC容器会先配置Bean B，然后调用Bean A的Setter方法来构造Bean A。换言之，Bean先会实例化，然后注入依赖，然后才是相关的生命周期方法的调用。\nExamples of dependency injection\n下面的例子会使用基于XML配置的元数据，然后使用Setter方式进行依赖注入。代码如下：\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    private AnotherBean beanOne;\n    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;\n    private int i;\n\n    public void setBeanOne(AnotherBean beanOne) {\n        this.beanOne = beanOne;\n    }\n\n    public void setBeanTwo(YetAnotherBean beanTwo) {\n        this.beanTwo = beanTwo;\n    }\n\n    public void setIntegerProperty(int i) {\n        this.i = i;\n    }\n\n}\n在上面的例子当中，Setter方法的声明和XML文件中相一致，下面的例子是基于构造函数的依赖注入\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    private AnotherBean beanOne;\n    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;\n    private int i;\n\n    public ExampleBean(\n        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {\n        this.beanOne = anotherBean;\n        this.beanTwo = yetAnotherBean;\n        this.i = i;\n    }\n\n}\n在Bean定义之中的构造函数参数就是用来构造ExampleBean的依赖。\n下面的例子，是通过静态的工厂方法来返回Bean实例的。\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    // a private constructor\n    private ExampleBean(...) {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    // a static factory method; the arguments to this method can be\n    // considered the dependencies of the bean that is returned,\n    // regardless of how those arguments are actually used.\n    public static ExampleBean createInstance (\n        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {\n\n        ExampleBean eb = new ExampleBean (...);\n        // some other operations...\n        return eb;\n    }\n\n}\n工厂方法的参数，也是通过 标签来指定的，和基于构造函数的依赖注入是一致的。之前有提到过，返回的类型不需要跟exampleBean中的class属性一致的，class指定的是包含工厂方法的类。当然了，上面的例子是一致的。使用factory-bean的实例工厂方法构造Bean的，这里就不多描述了。\n7.4.2 Dependencies and configuration in detail\n如前文所述，开发者可以通过定义Bean的依赖的来引用其他的Bean或者是一些值的，Spring基于XML的配置元数据通过支持一些子元素以及来达到这一目的。\nStraight values (primitives, Strings, and so on)\n元素有value属性来对人友好易读的形式配置一个属性或者构造参数。Spring的便利之处就是用来将这些字符串的值转换成指定的类型。\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n下面的例子使用的p命名空间，是更为简单的XML配置。\n\n\n    \n\n\n上面的XML更为的简洁，但是因为属性的类型是在运行时确定的，而非设计时确定的，所以除非使用IntelliJ IDEA或者Spring Tool Suite这些工具才能在定义Bean的时候自动完成属性配置。当然很推荐使用这些IDE。\n开发者也可以定义一个java.util.Properties实例，比如：\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            jdbc.driver.className=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n            jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\n        \n    \n\nSpring的容器会将里面的文本通过使用JavaBean的PropertyEditor机制转换成一个java.util.Properties实例。这也是一个捷径，也是一些Spring团队更喜欢使用嵌套的元素而不是value属性风格。\nidref元素\nidref元素是一种简单的提前校验错误的方式，通过id来关联容器中的其他的Bean的方式。\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n上述的Bean的定义在运行时，和如下定义是完全一致的。\n\n\n\n    \n\n第一种方式是更值得提倡的，因为使用了idref标签，会是的容器在部署阶段就针对Bean进行校验，确保Bean一定存在。而第二个版本的话，是没有任何校验的。只有实际上引用了Bean client，在实例化client的时候才会发现。如果client是一个prototype的Bean，那么类似拼写之类的错误会在容器部署以后很久才能发现。\n\nidref元素的local属性在4.0以后的xsd中已经不再支持了，而是使用了bean引用。如果更新了版本的话，需要将idref local引用都转换成 idref bean即可。\n\nReferences to other beans (collaborators)\nref元素在或者中的一个终极标签。开发者可以通过这个标签配置一个Bean来引用另一个Bean。当需要引用一个Bean的时候，被引用的Bean会先实例化，然后配置属性，也就是引用的依赖。如果该Bean是单例Bean的话，那么该Bean会早由容器初始化。最终的引用另一个对象的所有引用。Bean的范围以及校验取决于开发者是否通过bean,local,parent这些属性来指定对象的id或者name属性。\n通过指定Bean的bean属性中的来指定依赖是最常见的一种方式，可以引用容器或者父容器中的Bean，无论是否在同一个XML文件定义都可以引用。其中bean属性中的值可以和其他引用Bean中的id属性一致，或者和其中的一个name属性一致的。\n\n通过指定Bean的parent属性会创建一个引用到当前容器的父容器之中。parent属性的值可以跟跟目标Bean的id属性一致，或者和目标Bean的name属性中的一个一致，目标Bean必须是当前引用目标Bean容器的父容器。开发者一般只有在存在层次化容器，并且希望通过代理来包裹父容器中一个存在的Bean的时候才会用到这个属性。\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    class=\"org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean\">\n    \n         \n    \n    \n\n\n与idref标签一样，ref元素中的local标签在xsd 4.0以后已经不再支持了，开发者可以通过将已存在的ref local改为ref bean来完成更新Spring。\n\nInner beans\n定义在元素的或者元素之内的Bean叫做内部Bean\n\n    \n    \n         \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n内部Bean的定义是不需要指定id或者名字的。如果指定了，容器也不会用之作为分别Bean的区分标识。容器同时也会无视内部Bean的scope标签：内部Bean 总是 匿名的，而且 总是 随着外部的Bean同时创建的。开发者是无法将内部的Bean注入到外部Bean以外的其他Bean的。\n当然，也有可能从指定范围接收到破坏性回调。比如：一个请求范围的内部Bean包含了一个单例的Bean，那么内部Bean实例会绑定到包含的Bean，而包含的Bean允许访问到request的scope生命周期。这种场景不常见，内部Bean通常只是共享它的外部Bean。\nCollections\n在,,和元素中，开发者可以配置Java集合类型List,Set,Map以及Properties的属性和参数。\n\n    \n    \n        \n            administrator@example.org\n            support@example.org\n            development@example.org\n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            a list element followed by a reference\n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            just some string\n            \n        \n    \n\n当然，map的key或者value，或者是集合的value都可以配置为下列之中的一些元素：\nbean | ref | idref | list | set | map | props | value | null\n集合合并\nSpring的容器也支持来合并集合。开发者可以定义一个父样式的,,或者，同时有子样式的,,或者继承并且覆盖父集合。也就是说，子集合的值是父元素和子元素集合的合并值。比如下面的例子。\n\n    \n        \n            \n                administrator@example.com\n                support@example.com\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                sales@example.com\n                support@example.co.uk\n            \n        \n    \n\n可以发现，我们在childBean上使用了merge=true属性。当childBean由容器初始化且实例化的时候，其实例中包含的adminEmails集合就是child的adminEmails以及parent的adminEmails集合。如下：\nadministrator=administrator@example.com\nsales=sales@example.com\nsupport=support@example.co.uk\nchild的Properties集合的值继承了parent的，child的值也支持重写parent的值。\n这个合并的行为和,以及之类的集合类型的行为是类似的。的特定的例子中，与List集合类型类似，有隐含的ordered概念的。所有的父元素里面的值，是在所有孩子元素的值之前的。但是像Map,Set或者Properties的集合类型，是不存在顺序的。\n集合合并的限制\n开发者是不能够合并不同类型的集合的（比如Map和List合并），如果开发者这么做，会抛出异常。merge的属性是必须特指到更低级或者继承者，子节点的定义上。特指merge属性到父集合的定义上是冗余的，而且在合并上也没有任何效果。\n强类型集合\n在Java 5以后，开发者可以使用强类型的集合了。也就是，开发者可以声明一个Collection类型，然后这个集合只包含String元素（举例来说）。如果开发者通过Spring来注入强类型的Collection到Bean中，开发者就可以利用Spring的类型转换支持来做到。\npublic class Foo {\n\n    private Map accounts;\n\n    public void setAccounts(Map accounts) {\n        this.accounts = accounts;\n    }\n}\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n当foo的属性accounts准备注入的时候，accounts的泛型信息Map就会通过反射拿到。这样，Spring 的类型转换系统能够识别不同的类型，如上面的例子Float然后将字符串的值9.99, 2.75以及3.99转换成对应的Float类型。\nNull and empty string values\nSpring将会将属性的空参数，直接当成空字符串来处理。下面的基于XML的元数据配置就会将email属性配置为String的值为\"\"\n\n    \n\n上面的例子和下列JAVA代码是一致的。\nexampleBean.setEmail(\"\")\n而元素来处理null的值。如下：\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n上面的代码和下面的Java代码是一样的效果：\nexampleBean.setEmail(null)\nXML shortcut with the p-namespace\np命名空间令开发者可以使用bean的属性，而不用使用嵌套的元素，就能描述开发者想要注入的依赖。\nSpring是支持基于XML的格式化的命名空间扩展的。本节讨论的beans的配置都是基于XML的，p命名空间并不是定义在XSD文件，而是定义在Spring Core之中的。\n下面展示了两种XML片段是同样的解析结果：第一个使用的标准的XML格式，而第二种使用了p命名空间。\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n上面的例子在Bean中展示了email属性的定义。这种定义告知Spring这是一个属性的声明。如前面所描述，p命名空间并没有标准模式定义，所以你可以配置属性的名字为依赖名字。\n下面的例子包括了2个Bean定义，引用了另外的Bean：\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n从上述的例子中可以看出，john-modern不止包含一个属性，也同时使用了特殊的格式来声明一个引用指向另一个Bean。第一个Bean定义使用的是来创建的Bean引用到另外一个Bean，而第二个Bean的定义使用了p:spouse-ref=\"jane\"来作为一个指向Bean的引用。在这个例子中spouse是属性的名字，而-ref部分表名这个依赖不是直接的类型，而是引用另一个Bean。\n\np命名空间并不同标准的XML格式一样灵活。比如，声明属性的引用可能和一些以Ref结尾的属性相冲突，而标准的XML格式就不会。Spring团队推荐开发者能够和团队商量一下，要使用哪一种方式，而不要同时使用3种方法。\n\nXML shortcut with the c-namespace\n与p命名空间类似，c命名空间是在Spring 3.1首次引入的，c命名空间允许内联的属性来配置构造参数而不用使用constructor-arg元素。\n下面就是一个使用了c命名空间的例子：\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\nc:命名空间使用了和p:命名空间相类似的方式（使用了-ref来配置引用）。而且，同样的，c命名空间也不是定义在XSD的模式之中（但是在Spring Core之中）。\n在少数的例子之中，构造函数的参数名字并不可用（通常，如果字节码没有debug信息的编译），开发者可以使用下面的例子：\n\n\n\n根据XML语法，索引的概念的存在要求使用_作为XML属性名字不能以数字开始。\n\n实际上，构造函数的解析机制在匹配参数是很高效的，除非必要，Spring团队推荐在配置中使用命名空间。\nCompound property names\n开发者可以在配置属性的时候配置混合的属性，只要所有的组件路径（除了最后一个属性名字）不能为null。\n参考如下的定义。\n\n    \n\nfoo有一个fred的属性，而其中fred属性有一个bob属性，而bob属性之中有一个sammy属性，那么最后这个sammy属性会配置为123。想要上述的配置能够生效，fred属性需要有一个bob属性且在fred构造只是构造之后不为null，否则会抛出NullPointerException。\n7.4.3 Using depends-on\n如果一个Bean是另一个Bean的依赖的话，通常来说这个Bean也就是另一个Bean的属性之一。多数情况下，开发者可以在配置XML元数据的时候使用标签。然而，有时Bean之间的依赖关系不是直接关联的。比如：需要调用类的静态实例化器来触发，类似数据库驱动注册。depends-on属性会使明确的强迫依赖的Bean在引用之前就会初始化。下面的例子使用depends-on属性来让表示单例Bean上的依赖的。\n\n\n如果想要依赖多个Bean，可以提供多个名字作为depends-on的值，以逗号，空格，或者分号分割，如下：\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nBean中的depends-on属性可以同时指定一个初始化时间的依赖以及一个相应的销毁时依赖（单例Bean情况）。独立的定义了depends-on属性的Bean会优先销毁，优于被depends-on的Bean来销毁，这样depends-on可以控制销毁的顺序。\n\n7.4.4 Lazy-initialized beans\n默认情况下，ApplicationContext会在实例化的过程中创建和配置所有的单例Bean。总的来说，这个预初始化是很不错的。因为这样能及时发现环境上的一些配置错误，而不是系统运行了很久之后才发现。如果这个行为不是迫切需要的，开发者可以通过将Bean标记为延迟加载就能阻止这个预初始化。延迟初始化的Bean会通知IoC不要让Bean预初始化而是在被引用的时候才会实例化。\n在XML中，可以通过元素的lazy-init属性来控制这个行为。如下：\n\n\n当将Bean配置为上面的XML的时候，ApplicationContext之中的lazyBean是不会随着ApplicationContext的启动而进入到预初始化状态的，而那些非延迟加载的Bean是处于预初始化的状态的。\n然而，如果一个延迟加载的类是作为一个单例非延迟加载的Bean的依赖而存在的话，ApplicationContext仍然会在ApplicationContext启动的时候加载，因为作为单例Bean的依赖，会随着单例Bean的实例化而实例化。\n开发者可以通过使用的default-lazy-init属性来在容器层次控制Bean是否延迟初始化，比如：\n\n    \n\n7.4.5 Autowiring collaborators\nSpring容器可以根据Bean之间的依赖关系自动装配。开发者可以令Spring通过ApplicationContext来来自动解析这些关联。自动的装载有很多的优点：\n\n自动装载能够明显的减少指定的属性或者是构造参数。\n自动装载可以扩展开发者的对象。比如说，如果开发者需要加一个依赖，依赖就能够不需要开发者特别关心更改配置就能够自动满足。这样，自动装载在开发过程中是极度高效的，不用明确的选择装载的依赖会使系统更加的稳定。\n\n当使用基于XML的元数据配置的时候，开发者可以指定自动装配的方式。通过配置元素的autowire属性就可以了。自动装载有如下四种方式，开发者可以指定每个Bean的装载方式，这样Bean就知道如何加载自己的依赖。\n\n\n\n模式\n解释\n\n\n\n\nno\n（默认）不装载。Bean的引用必须通过ref元素来指定。对于比较大项目的部署，不建议修改默认的配置，因为特指会加剧控制。在某种程度上来说，默认的形式也说明了系统的结构。\n\n\nbyName\n通过名字来装配。Spring会查找所有的Bean直到名字和属性相同的一个Bean来进行装载。比如说，如果Bean配置为根据名字来自动装配，它包含了一个属性名字为master(也就是包含一个setMaster(..)方法)，Spring就会查找名字为master的Bean，然后用之装载\n\n\nbyType\n如果需要自动装配的属性的类型在容器之中存在的话，就会自动装配。如果容器之中存在不止一个类型匹配的话，就会抛出一个重大的异常，说明开发者最好不要使用byType来自动装配那个Bean。如果没有匹配的Bean存在的话，不会抛出异常，只是属性不会配置。\n\n\n构造函数\n类似于byType的注入，但是应用的构造函数的参数。如果没有一个Bean的类型和构造函数参数的类型一致，那么仍然会抛出一个重大的异常\n\n\n\n通过 byType 或者 构造函数 的自动装配方式，开发者可以装载数组和强类型集合。在如此的例子之中，所有容器之中的匹配指定类型的Bean会自动装配到Bean上来完成依赖注入。开发者可以自动装配key为String的强类型的Map。自动装配的Map值会包含所有的Bean实例值来匹配指定的类型，Map的key会包含关联的Bean的名字。\nLimitations and disadvantages of autowiring\n自动装载如果在整个的项目的开发过程中使用，会工作的很好。但是如果不是全局使用，而只是用之来自动装配几个Bean的话，会很容易迷惑开发者。\n下面是一些自动装配的劣势和限制\n\n精确的property以及constructor-arg参数配置，会覆盖掉自动装配的配置。开发不能够自动装配所谓的简单属性，比如Primitive类型或者字符串。\n自动装配并有精确装配准确。尽管如上面的表所描述，Spring会尽量小心来避免不必要的错误装配，但是Spring管理的对象关系仍然不如文档描述的那么精确。\n装配的信息对开发者可见性不好，因为这一切都由Spring容器管理。\n容器中的可能会存在很多的Bean匹配Setter方法或者构造参数。比如说数组，集合或者Map等。然而依赖却希望仅仅一个匹配的值，含糊的信息是无法解析的。如果没有独一无二的Bean，那么就会抛出异常。\n\n在后面的场景，开发者有如下的选择\n\n放弃自动装配有利于精确装配\n可以通过配置autowire-candidate属性为false来阻止自动装配\n通过配置元素的primary属性为true来指定一个bean为主要的候选Bean\n实现更多的基于注解的细粒度的装配配置。\n\nExcluding a bean from autowiring\n在每个Bean的基础之上，开发者可以阻止Bean来自动装配。在基于XML的配置中，可以配置元素的autowire-candidate属性为false来做到这一点。容器在读取到这个配置后，会让这个Bean对于自动装配的结构中不可见（包括注解形式的配置比如@Autowired）\n开发者可以通过模式匹配而不是Bean的名字来限制自动装配的候选者。最上层的元素会在default-autowire-candidates属性中来配置多种模式。比如，限制自动装配候选者的名字以Repository结尾，可以配置*Repository。如果需要配置多种模式，只需要用逗号分隔开即可。当然Bean中如果配置了autowire-candidate的话，这个信息拥有更高的优先级。\n上面的这些技术在配置那些不需要自动装配的Bean是很有效的。当然这并不是说这类Bean本身无法自动装配其他的Bean，而是说这些Bean不在作为自动装配依赖的候选了。\n7.4.6 Method injection\n在大多数的应用场景下，大多数的Bean都是单例的。当这个单例的Bean需要和另一个单例的或者非单例的Bean联合使用的时候，开发者只需要配置依赖的Bean为这个Bean的属性即可。但是有时会因为不同的Bean生命周期的不同而产生问题。假设单例的Bean A在每个方法调用中使用了非单例的Bean B。容器只会创建Bean A一次，而只有一个机会来配置属性。那么容器就无法给Bean A每次都提供一个新的Bean B的实例。\n一个解决方案就是放弃一些IoC。开发者可以通过实现ApplicationContextAware接口令Bean A可以看到ApplicationContext，从而通过调用getBean(\"B\")来在Bean A 需要新的实例的时候来获取到新的B实例。参考下面的例子：\n// a class that uses a stateful Command-style class to perform some processing\npackage fiona.apple;\n\n// Spring-API imports\nimport org.springframework.beans.BeansException;\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware;\n\npublic class CommandManager implements ApplicationContextAware {\n\n    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;\n\n    public Object process(Map commandState) {\n        // grab a new instance of the appropriate Command\n        Command command = createCommand();\n        // set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance\n        command.setState(commandState);\n        return command.execute();\n    }\n\n    protected Command createCommand() {\n        // notice the Spring API dependency!\n        return this.applicationContext.getBean(\"command\", Command.class);\n    }\n\n    public void setApplicationContext(\n            ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {\n        this.applicationContext = applicationContext;\n    }\n}\n上面的代码并不是让人十分满意，因为业务的代码已经与Spring框架耦合在了一起。Spring提供了一个稍微高级的点特性方法注入的方式，可以用来处理这种问题。\nLookup method injection\n查找方法注入就是容器一种覆盖容器管理Bean的方法，来返回查找的另一个容器中的Bean的能力。查找方法通常就包含前面场景提到的Bean。Spring框架通过使用CGLIB库生成的字节码来动态生成子类来覆盖父类的方法实现方法注入。\n\n\n为了让这个动态的子类方案正常，那么Spring容器所需要继承的这个Bean不能是final的，而覆盖的方法也不能是final的。\n针对这个类的单元测试因为存在抽象方法，所以必须实现子类来测试\n组件扫描的所需的具体方法也需要具体类。\n一个关键的限制在于查找方法与工厂方法是不能协同工作的，尤其是不能和配置类之中的@Bean的方法，因为容器不在负责创建实例，而是创建一个运行时的子类。\n最后，被注入的到方法的对象不能被序列化。\n\n\n看到前面的代码片段中的CommandManager类，我们发现发现Spring容器会动态的覆盖createCommand()方法。CommandManager类不在拥有任何的Spring依赖，如下：\npackage fiona.apple;\n\n// no more Spring imports!\n\npublic abstract class CommandManager {\n\n    public Object process(Object commandState) {\n        // grab a new instance of the appropriate Command interface\n        Command command = createCommand();\n        // set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance\n        command.setState(commandState);\n        return command.execute();\n    }\n\n    // okay... but where is the implementation of this method?\n    protected abstract Command createCommand();\n}\n在包含需要注入的方法的客户端类当中，注入的方法需要有如下的函数签名 \n [abstract]  theMethodName(no-arguments);\n如果方法为抽象，那么动态生成的子类会实现这个方法。否则，动态生成的子类会覆盖类中的定义的原方法。例如：\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n上面的commandManager在当它需要一个command Bean实例的时候就会调用自己的方法createCommand()。开发者一定要谨慎配置command Bean的为prototype类型的Bean。如果所需的Bean为单例的，那么这个方法注入返回的将都是同一个实例。\nArbitrary method replacement\n从前面的描述中，我们知道查找方法是有能力来覆盖任何由容器管理的Bean的方法的。开发者最好跳过这一部分，除非一定需要使用这个功能。\n通过配置基于XML的配置元数据，开发者可以使用replaced-method元素来替换一个存在的方法的实现。考虑如下情况：\npublic class MyValueCalculator {\n\n    public String computeValue(String input) {\n        // some real code...\n    }\n\n    // some other methods...\n\n}\n一个实现了org.springframework.beans.factory.support.MethodReplacer接口的类会提供一个新方法的定义。\n/**\n * meant to

Core Technologies/Bean scopes.html":{"url":"III. Core Technologies/Bean scopes.html","title":"Bean作用域","keywords":"","body":"Bean scopes\n当开发者定义Bean的时候，同时也会定义了该如何创建Bean实例。这些具体创建的过程是很重要的，因为只有通过对这些过程的配置，开发者才能创建实例对象。\n开发者不仅可以控制注入不同的依赖到Bean之中，也可以配置Bean的作用域。这种方法是非常强大而且弹性也非常好的。开发者可以通过配置来指定对象的作用域，而不用在Java类层次上来配置。Bean可以配置多种作用域。\nSpring框架支持5种作用域，有三种作用域是当开发者使用基于web的ApplicationContext的时候才生效的。\n下面就是Spring直接支持的作用域了，当然开发者也可以自己定制作用域。\n\n\n\n作用域\n描述\n\n\n\n\n单例(singleton)\n（默认）每一个Spring IoC容器都拥有唯一的一个实例对象\n\n\n原型（prototype）\n一个Bean定义可以创建任意多个实例对象\n\n\n请求（request）\n一个HTTP请求会产生一个Bean对象，也就是说，每一个HTTP请求都有自己的Bean实例。只在基于web的Spring ApplicationContext中可用\n\n\n会话（session）\n限定一个Bean的作用域为HTTPsession的生命周期。同样，只有基于web的Spring ApplicationContext才能使用\n\n\n全局会话（global session）\n限定一个Bean的作用域为全局HTTPSession的生命周期。通常用于门户网站场景，同样，只有基于web的Spring ApplicationContext可用\n\n\n应用(application)\n限定一个Bean的作用域为ServletContext的生命周期。同样，只有基于web的Spring ApplicationContext可用\n\n\n\n\n在Spring 3.0中，线程作用域是可用的，但不是默认注册的。想了解更多的信息，可以参考本文后面关于SimpleThreadScope的文档。想要了解如何注册这个或者其他的自定义的作用域，可以参考后面的内容。\n\nThe singleton scope\n单例Bean全局只有一个共享的实例，所有将单例Bean作为依赖的情况下，容器返回将是同一个实例。\n换言之，当开发者定义一个Bean的作用域为单例时，Spring IoC容器只会根据Bean定义来创建该Bean的唯一实例。这些唯一的实例会缓存到容器中，后续针对单例Bean的请求和引用，都会从这个缓存中拿到这个唯一的实例。\n\nSpring的单例Bean和与设计模式之中的所定义的单例模式是有所区别的。设计模式中的单例模式是将一个对象的作用域硬编码的，一个ClassLoader只有唯一的一个实例。\n而Spring的单例作用域，是基于每个容器，每个Bean只有一个实例。这意味着，如果开发者根据一个类定义了一个Bean在单个的Spring容器中，那么Spring容器会根据Bean定义创建一个唯一的Bean实例。\n单例作用域是Spring的默认作用域，下面的例子是在基于XML的配置中配置单例模式的Bean。\n\n\n\n\nThe prototype scope\n非单例的，原型的Bean指的就是每次请求Bean实例的时候，返回的都是新实例的Bean对象。也就是说，每次注入到另外的Bean或者通过调用getBean()来获得的Bean都将是全新的实例。\n这是基于线程安全性的考虑，如果使用有状态的Bean对象用原型作用域，而无状态的Bean对象用单例作用域。\n下面的例子说明了Spring的原型作用域。DAO通常不会配置为原型对象，因为典型的DAO是不会有任何的状态的。\n\n下面的例子展示了XML中如何定义一个原型的Bean：\n\n与其他的作用域相比，Spring是不会完全管理原型Bean的生命周期的：Spring容器只会初始化，配置以及装载这些Bean，传递给Client。但是之后就不会再去管原型Bean之后的动作了。\n也就是说，初始化生命周期回调方法在所有作用域的Bean是都会调用的，但是销毁生命周期回调方法在原型Bean是不会调用的。所以，客户端代码必须注意清理原型Bean以及释放原型Bean所持有的一些资源。\n可以通过使用自定义的bean post-processor来让Spring释放掉原型Bean所持有的资源。\n在某些方面来说，Spring容器的角色就是取代了Java的new操作符，所有的生命周期的控制需要由客户端来处理。\nSingleton beans with prototype-bean dependencies\n当使用单例Bean的时候，而该单例Bean的依赖是原型Bean的时候，需要注意的是依赖的解析都是在初始化的阶段的。因此，如果将原型Bean注入到单例的Bean之中，只会请求一次原型的Bean，然后注入到单例的Bean之中。这个依赖的原型Bean仍然属于只有一个实例的。\n然而，假设你需要单例Bean对原型的Bean的依赖需要每次在运行时都请求一个新的实例，那么你就不能够将一个原型的Bean来注入到一个单例的Bean当中了，因为依赖注入只会进行一次。\n当Spring容器在实例化单例Bean的时候，就会解析以及注入它所需的依赖。如果实在需要每次都请求一个新的实例，可以参考Dependencies中的方法注入部分。\nRequest, session, global session, application, and WebSocket scopes\nrequest,session以及global session这三个作用域都是只有在基于web的SpringApplicationContext实现的（比如XmlWebApplicationContext）中才能使用。\n如果开发者仅仅在常规的Spring IoC容器中比如ClassPathXmlApplicationContext中使用这些作用域，那么将会抛出一个IllegalStateException来说明使用了未知的作用域。\nInitial web configuration\n为了能够使用request,session以及global session作用域（web范围的Bean）,需要在配置Bean之前配置做一些基础的配置。（对于标准的作用域，比如singleton以及prototype，是无需这些基础的配置的）\n具体如何配置取决于Servlet的环境。\n比如如果开发者使用了Spring Web MVC框架的话，每一个请求会通过Spring的DispatcherServlet或者DispatcherPortlet来处理的，也就没有其他特殊的初始化配置。DispatcherServlet和DispatcherPortlet已经包含了相关的状态。\n如果使用Servlet 2.5的web容器，请求不是通过Spring的DispatcherServlet（比如JSF或者Struts）来处理。那么开发者需要注册org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener或者ServletRequestListener。\n而在Servlet 3.0以后，这些都能够通过WebApplicationInitializer接口来实现。或者，如果是一些旧版本的容器的话，可以在web.xml中增加如下的Listener声明：\n\n    ...\n    \n        \n            org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener\n        \n    \n    ...\n\n如果是对Listener不甚熟悉，也可以考虑使用Spring的RequestContextFilter。Filter的映射取决于web应用的配置，开发者可以根据如下例子进行适当的修改。\n\n    ...\n    \n        requestContextFilter\n        org.springframework.web.filter.RequestContextFilter\n    \n    \n        requestContextFilter\n        /*\n    \n    ...\n\nDispatcherServlet，RequestContextListener以及RequestContextFilter做的本质上完全一致，都是绑定request对象到服务请求的Thread上。这才使得Bean在之后的调用链上在请求和会话范围上可见。\nRequest scope\n参考如下的Bean定义\n\nSpring容器会在每次用到loginAction来处理每个HTTP请求的时候都会创建一个新的LoginAction实例。也就是说，loginActionBean的作用域是HTTPRequest级别的。\n开发者可以随意改变实例的状态，因为其他通过loginAction请求来创建的实例根本看不到开发者改变的实例状态，所有创建的Bean实例都是根据独立的请求来的。当请求处理完毕，这个Bean也会销毁。\nSession scope\n参考如下的Bean定义：\n\nSpring容器会在每次调用到userPreferences在一个单独的HTTP会话周期来创建一个新的UserPreferences实例。换言之，userPreferencesBean的作用域是HTTPSession级别的。\n在request-scoped作用域的Bean上，开发者可以随意的更改实例的状态，同样，其他的HTTPSession基本的实例在每个Session都会请求userPreferences来创建新的实例，所以开发者更改Bean的状态，对于其他的Bean仍然是不可见的。当HTTPSession销毁了，那么根据这个Session来创建的Bean也就销毁了。\nGlobal session scope\n\n该部分主要是描述portlet的，详情可以Google更多关于portlet的相关信息。\n\n参考如下的Bean定义：\n\nglobal session作用域比较类似之前提到的标准的HTTPSession，这种作用域是只应用于基于门户（portlet-based）的web应用的上下之中的。门户的Spec中定义的global session的意义：global session被所有构成门户的web应用所共享。定义为global session作用域的Bean是作用在全局门户Session的声明周期的。\n如果在使用标准的基于Servlet的Web应用，而且定义了global session作用域的Bean，那么只是会使用标准的HTTPSession作用域，不会报错。\nApplication scope\n考虑如下的Bean定义：\n\nSpring容器会在整个web应用使用到appPreferences的时候创建一个新的AppPreferences的实例。也就是说，appPreferencesBean是在ServletContext级别的，好似一个普通的ServletContext属性一样。这种作用域在一些程度上来说和Spring的单例作用域是极为相似的，但是也有如下不同之处：\n\napplication作用域是每个ServletContext中包含一个，而不是每个SpringApplicationContext之中包含一个（某些应用中可能包含不止一个ApplicationContext）。\napplication作用域仅仅作为ServletContext的属性可见，单例Bean是ApplicationContext可见。\n\nScoped beans as dependencies\nSpring IoC容器不仅仅管理对象（Bean）的实例化，同时也负责装载依赖。如果开发者想装载一个Bean到一个作用域更广的Bean当中去（比如HTTP请求返回的Bean）,那么开发者选择注入一个AOP代理而不是短作用域的Bean。也就是说，开发者需要注入一个代理对象，这个代理对象既可以找到实际的Bean，也能够创建一个全新的Bean。\n\n开发者会在单例Bean中使用标签，来引用一个代理，这个代理的作用就是用来获取指定的Bean。\n当声明使用来生成一个原型Bean的时候，每个通过代理的调用都会产生一个新的目标实例。\n并且，作用域代理并不是唯一来获取短作用域Bean的唯一安全的方式。开发者也可以通过简单的声明注入为ObjectFactory，允许通过类似getObject()之类的调用来获取一些指定的依赖，而不是直接储存依赖的实例。\nJSR-330关于这部分的名称不同叫做Provider，通过使用Provider声明和一个相关的get()方法来获取指定的依赖。详细关于JSR-330的信息可以进去详细了解。\n\n请参考下面的例子：\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n使用代理，只需要在短作用域的Bean定义之中加入一个子节点即可。Dependencies中的方法注入中就提及到了Bean依赖的一些问题，这也是我们为什么要使用aop代理的原因。假设我们没有使用aop代理而是直接进行依赖注入，参考如下的例子：\n\n\n\n    \n\n上面的例子中，userManager明显是一个单例的Bean，注入了一个HTTPSession级别的userPreferences依赖，显然的问题就是userManager在Spring容器中只会实例化一次，而依赖(当前例子中的userPreferences)也只能注入一次。这也就意味着userManager每次使用的都是相同的userPreferences对象。\n那么这种情况就绝对不是开发者想要的那种将短作用域注入到长作用域Bean中的情况了，举例来说，注入一个HTTPSession级别的Bean到一个单例之中，或者说，当开发者通过userManager来获取指定与某个HTTPSession的userPreferences对象都是不可能的。所以容器创建了一个获取UserPreferences对象的接口，这个接口可以根据Bean对象作用域机制来获取与作用域相关的对象（比如说HTTPRequest或者HTTPSession等）。容器之后注入代理对象到userManager中，而意识不到所引用UserPreferences是代理。在这个例子之中，当UserManager实例调用方法来获取注入的依赖UserPreferences对象时，其实只会调用了代理的方法，由代理去获取真正的对象，在这个例子中就是HTTPSession级别的Bean。\n所以当开发者希望能够正确的使用配置request,session或者globalSession级别的Bean来作为依赖时，需要进行如下的类似配置：\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n选择代理的类型\n默认情况下，Spring容器创建代理的时候标记为的标签时，会创建一个基于CGLIB的代理。\n\nCGLIB代理会拦截public方法调用！所以不要在非public方法上使用代理，这样将不会获取到指定的依赖。\n\n或者，开发者可以通过指标签的proxy-target-class属性的值为false来配置Spring容器来为这些短作用域的Bean创建一个标准JDK的基于接口的代理。使用JDK基于接口的代理意味着开发者不需要在应用的路径引用额外的库来完成代理。当然，这也意味着短作用域的Bean需要额外实现一个接口，而依赖是从这些接口来获取的。\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\nDefaultUserPreferences实现了UserPreferences而且提供了接口来获取实际的对象。更多的信息可以参考AOP代理。\nCustom scopes\nBean的作用域机制是可扩展的，开发者可以定义自己的一些作用域，甚至重新定义已经存在的作用域，但是这一点Spring团队是不推荐的，并且开发者不能够重写singleton以及prototype作用域。\nCreating a custom scope\n为了能够使Spring可以管理开发者定义的作用域，开发者需要实现org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope接口。想知道如何实现开发者自己定义的作用域，可以参考Spring框架的一些实现或者是Scope的javadoc，里面会解释开发者需要实现的一些细节。\nScope接口中含有4个方法来获取对象，移除对象，允许销毁等。\n下面的方法返回一个存在的作用域的对象。比如说Session的作用域实现，该函数将返回会话作用域的Bean（如果Bean不存在，该方法会创建一个新的实例）\nObject get(String name, ObjectFactory objectFactory)\n下面的方法会将对象移出作用域。同样，以Session为例，该函数会删除Session作用域的Bean。删除的对象会作为返回值返回，当无法找到对象的时候可以返回null。\nObject remove(String name)\n下面的方法会注册一个回调方法，当需要销毁或者作用域销毁的时候调用。详细可以参考在javadoc和Spring作用域的实现中找到更多关于销毁回调方法的信息。\nvoid registerDestructionCallback(String name, Runnable destructionCallback)\n下面的方法会获取作用域的区分标识，区分标识区别于其他的作用域。\nString getConversationId()\nUsing a custom scope\n在实现了开发者的自定义作用域之后，开发者还需要让Spring容器能够识别发现这个新的作用域。下面的方法就是在Spring容器中用来注册新的作用域的。\nvoid registerScope(String scopeName, Scope scope);\n这个方法是在ConfigurableBeanFactory的接口中声明的，在大多数的ApplicationContext的实现中都是可以用的，可以通过BeanFactory属性来调用。\nregisterScope(..)方法的第一个参数是作用域相关联的唯一的一个名字；举例来说，比如Spring容器之中的singleton和prototype就是这样的名字。第二个参数就是我们根据Scope接口所实现的具体的对象。\n假定开发者实现了自定义的作用域，然后按照如下步骤来注册。\n\n下面的例子使用了SimpleThreadScope，这个例子Spring中是有实现的，但是没有默认注册。开发者自实现的Scope也可以通过如下方式来注册。\n\nScope threadScope = new SimpleThreadScope();\nbeanFactory.registerScope(\"thread\", threadScope);\n之后，开发者可以通过如下类似的Bean定义来使用自定义的Scope:\n\n在定制的Scope中，开发者也不限于仅仅通过编程方式来注册自己的Scope，开发者可以通过下面CustomScopeConfigurer类来实现：\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n"},"III. Core Technologies/Customizing the nature of a bean.html":{"url":"III. Core Technologies/Customizing the nature of a bean.html","title":"定制Bean的回调函数","keywords":"","body":"Customing the nature of a bean\nLifecycle callbacks\n开发者通过实现Spring的InitializeingBean和DisposableBean接口，就可以让容器来管理Bean的生命周期。容器会在调用afterPropertiesSet()之后和destroy()之前会允许Bean在初始化和销毁Bean的时候执行一些操作。\n\nJSR-250的@PostConstruct和@PreDestroy注解就是现代Spring应用生命周期回调的最佳实践。使用这些注解意味着Bean不会再耦合在Spring特定的接口上。详细内容，后续将会介绍。\n如果开发者不想使用JSR-250的注解，仍然可以考虑使用init-method和destroy-method的定义来解耦Spring接口。\n\n内部来说，Spring框架使用BeanPostProcessor的实现来处理接口的回调，BeanPostProcessor能够找到并调用合适的方法。如果开发者需要定制一些Spring并不直接提供的生命周期行为，开发者可以考虑自行实现一个BeanPostProcessor。更多的信息可以参考后面的容器扩展点。\n除了初始化和销毁回调，Spring管理的对象也实现了Lifecycle接口来让管理的对象在容器的生命周期内启动和关闭。\n生命周期回调在本节会进行详细描述。\nInitialization callbacks\norg.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean接口允许Bean在所有的必要的依赖配置配置完成后来执行初始化Bean的操作。InitializingBean接口中特指了一个方法：\nvoid afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception;\nSpring团队是建议开发者不要使用InitializingBean接口的，因为这样会将代码耦合到Spring的特定接口之上。而通过使用@PostConstruct注解或者指定一个POJO的实现方法，会比实现接口要更好。在基于XML的配置元数据上，开发者可以使用init-method属性来指定一个没有参数的方法。使用Java配置的开发者可以使用@Bean之中的initMethod属性，比如如下：\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    public void init() {\n        // do some initialization work\n    }\n\n}\n与如下代码一样效果：\n\npublic class AnotherExampleBean implements InitializingBean {\n\n    public void afterPropertiesSet() {\n        // do some initialization work\n    }\n\n}\n但是前一个版本的代码是没有耦合到Spring的。\nDestruction callbacks\n实现了org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean接口的Bean就能通让容器通过回调来销毁Bean所引用的资源。DisposableBean接口包含了一个方法：\nvoid destroy() throws Exception;\n同InitializingBean相类似，Spring团队仍然不建议开发者来实现DisposableBean回调接口，因为这样会将开发者的代码耦合到Spring代码上。换种方式，比如使用@PreDestroy注解或者指定一个Bean支持的配置方法，比如在基于XML的配置元数据中，开发者可以在Bean标签上指定destroy-method属性。而在基于Java配置中，开发者也可以配置@Bean的destroyMethod来实现销毁回调。\n\npublic class ExampleBean {\n\n    public void cleanup() {\n        // do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)\n    }\n\n}\n上面的代码配置和如下配置是等同的：\n\npublic class AnotherExampleBean implements DisposableBean {\n\n    public void destroy() {\n        // do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)\n    }\n\n}\n但是第一段代码是没有耦合到Spring的。\n\n标签的destroy-method可以被配置为特殊指定的值，来方便让Spring能够自动的检查到close或者shutdown方法（可以实现java.lang.AutoCloseable或者java.io.Closeable都会匹配。）这个特殊指定的值可以配置到的default-destroy-method来让所有的Bean实现这个行为。\n\nDefault initialization and destroy methods\n当开发者不使用Spring特有的InitializingBean和DisposableBean回调接口来实现初始化和销毁方法的时候，开发者通常定义的方法名字都是好似init()，initialize()或者是dispose()等等。那么，可以将这类的方法在项目中标准化，来让所有的开发者都使用一样的名字来确保一致性。\n开发者可以配置Spring容器来针对每一个Bean都查找这种名字的初始化和销毁回调函数。也就是说，任何的一个应用开发者，都会在应用的类中使用一个叫init()的初始化回调，而不需要在每个Bean中定义init-method=\"init\"这中属性。Spring IoC容器会在Bean创建的时候调用那个方法（就如前面描述的标准生命周期一样。）这个特性也将强制开发者为其他的初始化以及销毁回调函数使用同样的名字。\n假设开发者的初始化回调方法名字为init()而销毁的回调方法为destroy()。那么开发者的类就会好似如下的代码：\npublic class DefaultBlogService implements BlogService {\n\n    private BlogDao blogDao;\n\n    public void setBlogDao(BlogDao blogDao) {\n        this.blogDao = blogDao;\n    }\n\n    // this is (unsurprisingly) the initialization callback method\n    public void init() {\n        if (this.blogDao == null) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"The [blogDao] property must be set.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n标签上面的default-init-method属性会让Spring IoC容器识别叫做init的方法来作为Bean的初始化回调方法。当Bean创建和装载之后，如果Bean有这么一个方法的话，Spring容器就会在合适的时候调用。\n类似的，开发者也可以配置默认销毁回调函数，基于XML的配置就在标签上面使用default-destroy-method属性。\n当存在一些Bean的类有了一些回调函数，而和配置的默认回调函数不同的时候，开发者可以通过特指的方式来覆盖掉默认的回调函数。以XML为例，就是通过使用标签的init-method和destroy-method来覆盖掉中的配置。\nSpring容器会做出如下保证，Bean会在装载了所有的依赖以后，立刻就开始执行初始化回调。这样的话，初始化回调只会在直接的Bean引用装载好后调用，而AOP拦截器还没有应用到Bean上。首先目标Bean会完全初始化好，然后，AOP代理以及其拦截链才能应用。如果目标Bean以及代理是分开定义的，那么开发者的代码甚至可以跳过AOP而直接和引用的Bean交互。因此，在初始化方法中应用拦截器会前后矛盾，因为这样做耦合了目标Bean的生命周期和代理/拦截器，还会因为同Bean直接交互而产生奇怪的现象。\nCombining lifecycle mechanisms\n在Spring 2.5之后，开发者有三种选择来控制Bean的生命周期行为：\n\nInitializingBean和DisposableBean回调接口\n自定义的init()以及destroy方法\n使用@PostConstruct以及@PreDestroy注解\n\n开发者也可以在Bean上联合这些机制一起使用\n\n如果Bean配置了多个生命周期机制，而且每个机制配置了不同的方法名字，那么每个配置的方法会按照后面描述的顺序来执行。然而，如果配置了相同的名字，比如说初始化回调为init()，在不止一个生命周期机制配置为这个方法的情况下，这个方法只会执行一次。\n\n如果一个Bean配置了多个生命周期机制，并且含有不同的方法名，执行的顺序如下：\n\n包含@PostConstruct注解的方法\n在InitializingBean接口中的afterPropertiesSet()方法\n自定义的init()方法\n\n销毁方法的执行顺序和初始化的执行顺序相同：\n\n包含@PreDestroy注解的方法\n在DisposableBean接口中的destroy()方法\n自定义的destroy()方法\n\nStartup and shutdown callbacks\nLifecycle接口中为任何有自己生命周期需求的对象定义了一些基本的方法（比如启动和停止一些后台进程）:\npublic interface Lifecycle {\n\n    void start();\n\n    void stop();\n\n    boolean isRunning();\n\n}\n任何Spring管理的对象都可实现上面的接口。那么当ApplicationContext本身收到了启动或者停止的信号时，比如运行时的停止或者重启等场景，ApplicationContext会通知到所有上下文中包含的生命周期对象，ApplicationContext通过将代理到LifecycleProcessor来串联上下文中的Lifecycle的实现对象。\npublic interface LifecycleProcessor extends Lifecycle {\n\n    void onRefresh();\n\n    void onClose();\n\n}\n从上面代码我们可以发现LifecycleProcessor是Lifecycle接口的扩展。LifecycleProcessor增加了另外的两个方法来针对上下文的刷新和关闭做出反应。\n\n常规的org.springframework.context.Lifecycle接口只是为明确的开始/停止通知提供一个契约，而并不表示在上下文刷新会自动开始。考虑实现org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle接口则可以取代在某个Bean的自动启动过程（包括启动阶段）。同时，停止通知并不能保证在销毁之前出现：在正常的关闭情况下，所有的LifecycleBean都会在销毁回调准备好之前收到停止通知，然而，在上下文存活期的热刷新或者停止刷新尝试的时候，只会调用销毁方法。\n\n启动和关闭调用是很重要的。如果不同的Bean之间存在depends-on的关系的话，被依赖的一方需要更早的启动，而且关闭的更早。然而，有的时候直接的依赖是未知的，而开发者仅仅知道哪一种类型需要更早进行初始化。在这种情况下，SmartLifecycle接口定义了另一种选项，就是其父接口Phased中的getPhase()方法。\npublic interface Phased {\n\n    int getPhase();\n\n}\npublic interface SmartLifecycle extends Lifecycle, Phased {\n\n    boolean isAutoStartup();\n\n    void stop(Runnable callback);\n\n}\n当启动时，拥有最低的phased的对象优先启动，而当关闭时，是相反的顺序。因此，如果一个对象实现了SmartLifecycle然后令其getPhase()方法返回了Integer.MIN_VALUE的话，就会让该对象最早启动，而最晚销毁。显然，如果getPhase()方法返回了Integer.MAX_VALUE就说明了该对象会最晚启动，而最早销毁。当考虑到使用phased的值得时候，也同时需要了解正常没有实现SmartLifecycle的Lifecycle对象的默认值，这个值为0。因此，任何负值将标明对象会在标准组件启动之前启动，在标准组件销毁以后再进行销毁。\nSmartLifecycle接口也定义了一个stop的回调函数。任何实现了SmartLifecycle接口的函数都必须在关闭流程完成之后调用回调中的run()方法。这样做可以使能异步关闭。而LifecycleProcessor的默认实现DefaultLifecycleProcessor会等到配置的超时时间之后再调用回调。默认的每一阶段的超时时间为30秒。开发者可以通过定义一个叫做lifecycleProcessor的Bean来覆盖默认的生命周期处理器。如果开发者需要配置超时时间，可以通过如下代码进行配置：\n\n    \n    \n\n前文提到的，LifecycleProcessor接口定义了回调方法来刷新和关闭上下文。关闭的话，如果stop()方法已经明确调用了，那么就会驱动关闭的流程，但是如果是上下文正在关闭就不会发生这种情况。而刷新的回调会使用SmartLifecycle的另一个特性。当上下文刷新完毕（所有的对象已经实例化并初始化），那么就会调用回调，默认的生命周期处理器会检查每一个SmartLifecycle对象的isAutoStartup()返回的Bool值。如果为真，对象将会自动启动而不是等待明确的上下文调用，或者调用自己的start()方法(不同于上下文刷新，标准的上下文实现是不会自动启动的)。phased的值以及depends-on关系会决定对象启动和销毁的顺序。\nShutting down the Spring IoC container gracefully in non-web applications\n\n这一部分只是针对于非Web的应用。Spring的基于web的ApplicationContext实现已经有代码在web应用关闭的时候能够自动的的关闭Spring IoC容器。\n\n如果开发者在非web应用环境使用Spring IoC容器的话， 比如，在桌面客户端的环境下，开发者需要在JVM上注册一个关闭的钩子，来确保在关闭Spring IoC容器的时候能够调用相关的销毁方法来释放掉引用的资源。当然，开发者也必须要正确的配置和实现那些销毁回调。\n开发者可以在ConfigurableApplicationContext接口调用registerShutdownHook()来注册销毁的钩子：\nimport org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;\nimport org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;\n\npublic final class Boot {\n\n    public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {\n\n        ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\n                new String []{\"beans.xml\"});\n\n        // add a shutdown hook for the above context...\n        ctx.registerShutdownHook();\n\n        // app runs here...\n\n        // main method exits, hook is called prior to the app shutting down...\n\n    }\n}\nApplicationContextAware and BeanNameAware\n当ApplicationContext在创建实现了org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware接口的对象时，该对象的实例会包含一个到ApplicationContext的引用。\npublic interface ApplicationContextAware {\n\n    void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException;\n\n}\n这样Bean就能够通过编程的方式操作和创建ApplicationContext了。通过ApplicationContext接口，或者通过将引用转换成已知的接口的子类，比如ConfigurableApplicationContext就能够提供一些额外的功能。其中的一个用法就是可以通过编程的方式来获取其他的Bean。有的时候这个能力很有用。当然，Spring团队推荐最好不要这样做，因为这样会耦合代码到Spring上，同时也没有遵循IoC的风格。ApplicationContext的其它的方法可以提供一些到诸如资源的访问，发布应用事件，或者进入MessageSource之类的功能。这些信息在后续的针对ApplicationContext的描述中会讲到。\n在Spring 2.5版本中，自动装载也是获得ApplicationContext的一种方式。传统的构造函数和通过类型的装载方式（前文依赖中有相关描述）可以通过构造函数或者是setter方法的方式注入，开发者也可以通过注解注入的方式。\n当ApplicationContext创建了一个实现了org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanNameAware接口的类，那么这个类就可以针对其名字进行配置。\npublic interface BeanNameAware {\n\n    void setBeanName(string name) throws BeansException;\n\n}\n这个回调的调用处于属性配置完以后，但是初始化回调之前。比如InitializingBean的afterPropertiesSet()方法以及自定义的初始化方法等。\nOther Aware interfaces\n除了上面描述的两种Aware接口，Spring还提供了一系列的Aware接口来让Bean告诉容器，这些Bean需要一些具体的基础设施信息。最重要的一些Aware接口都在下面表中进行了描述：\n\n\n\n名字\n注入的依赖\n\n\n\n\nApplicationContextAware\n声明的ApplicationContext\n\n\nApplicationEventPlulisherAware\nApplicationContext中的事件发布器\n\n\nBeanClassLoaderAware\n加载Bean使用的类加载器\n\n\nBeanFactoryAware\n声明的BeanFactory\n\n\nBeanNameAware\nBean的名字\n\n\nBootstrapContextAware\n容器运行的资源适配器BootstrapContext，通常仅在JCA环境下有效\n\n\nLoadTimeWeaverAware\n加载期间处理类定义的weaver\n\n\nMessageSourceAware\n解析消息的配置策略\n\n\nNotificationPublisherAware\nSpring

Core Technologies/Container Extension Points.html","title":"容器扩展点","keywords":"","body":"6.8 Container Extension Points\n通常，应用程序开发者，不需要继承ApplicationContext的实现类。相反，Spring IoC容器可以通过插入特殊的集成接口的实现进行拓展。新的一节中，描述了这些集成接口。\n6.8.1 Customizing beans using a BeanPostProcessor\nBeanPostProcessor定义了回调方法，通过实现这个回调方法，你可以提供你自己的(或者重写容器默认的)实例化逻辑，依赖分析逻辑等等。如果你想在Spring容器完成实例化，配置，和初始化bean之后，实例化一些自定义的逻辑，你可以插入一个或多个BeanPostProcessor的实现。\n你可以配置多个BeanPostProcessor实例，你可以通过设置order属性来控制这些BeanPostProcessors执行的顺序。你可以设置这个属性仅当BeanPostProcessor实现了Ordered接口。如果你编写自己的BeanPostProcessor你也应该考虑实现Ordered接口。更多细节，请查看BeanPostProcessor和Ordered接口的javadocs，也可以看看下面的要点programmatic registration of BeanPostProcessors。\n\nBeanPostProcessors作用在一个bean(或者对象)的实例上;也就是说，Spring IoC实例化一个bean实例之后， BeanPostProcessors，才开始进行处理。\nBeanPostProcessors作用范围是每一个容器。这仅仅和你正在使用容器有关。如果你在一个容器中定义了一个BeanPostProcessor ，它将仅仅后置处理那个容器中的beans。换言之，一个容器中的beans不会被另一个容器中的BeanPostProcessor处理，即使这两个容器，具有相同的父类。\n为了改变实际的bean定义(例如， blueprint 定义的bean)，你反而需要使用BeanFactoryPostProcessor，就像在Section 5.8.2, “Customizing configuration metadata with a BeanFactoryPostProcessor”中描述的那样。\n\norg.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor接口，由两个回调方法组成。当这样的一个类注册为容器的一个后置处理器，由于每一个bean实例都是由容器创建的，这个后置处理器会在容器的初始化方法(比如InitializingBean的afterPropertiesSet()和任何生命的初始化方法)被调用之前和任何bean实例化回调之后从容器得到一个回调方法。后置处理器，可以对bean采取任何措施，包括完全忽略回调。一个bean后置处理器，通常会检查回调接口或者使用代理包装一个bean。一些Spring AOP基础设施类，为了提供包装式的代理逻辑，被实现为bean后置处理器。\nApplicationContext会自动地检测所有定义在配置元文件中，并实现了BeanPostProcessor接口的bean。该ApplicationContext注册这些beans作为后置处理器，使他们可以在bean创建完成之后被调用。bean后置处理器可以像其他bean一样部署到容器中。\n注意，当在一个配置类上，使用@Bean工厂方法声明一个BeanPostProcessor，工厂方法返回的类型应该是实现类自身，或至少也要是 org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor接口，要清楚地表明这个bean的后置处理器本质特点。否则，在它完全创建之前，ApplicationContext将不能通过类型自动探测它。由于一个BeanPostProcessor，早期就需要被实例化，以适应上下文中其他bean的实例化，因此这个早期的类型检查是至关重要的。\n\n虽然推荐使用ApplicationContext的自动检测来注册BeanPostProcessor，但是也可以编程式地使用ConfigurableBeanFactory的addBeanPostProcessor方法来注册。 这对于在注册之前需要对条件逻辑进行评估，或者是在继承层次的上下文之间复制bean后置处理器是有很有用的。但是请注意，编程地添加的BeanPostProcessors不需要考虑Ordered接口。也就是注册的顺序决定了执行的顺序。也要注意，编程式注册的BeanPostProcessors，总是预先被处理----早于通过自动检测方式注册的，同时忽略任何明确的排序。\n实现了BeanPostProcessor接口的类是特殊的,会被容器特殊处理。所有BeanPostProcessors和他们直接引用的 beans都会在容器启动的时候被实例化,作为ApplicationContext特殊启动阶段的一部分。接着，所有的BeanPostProcessors 以一个有序的方式进行注册，并应用于容器中的一切bean。因为AOP自动代理本身被实现为BeanPostProcessor，这个BeanPostProcessors和它直接应用的beans都没有资格进行自动代理，这样就没有切面编织到他们里面。对于所有这样的bean，你会看到一个info日志：\"Bean foo is not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessor interfaces (for example: not eligible for auto-proxying)\"。\n注意，如果你有beans使用自动装配或者@Resource装配到了你的BeanPostProcessor中，当根据依赖搜索匹配类型时，Spring也许会访问意外类型的bean；因此，使它们没有资格进行自动代理，或者其他类型的bean后置处理。例如，你使用@Resource注解一个依赖，其中字段或者set方法名，不是和bean声明的名字直接对应，同时没有name属性被使用，然后，Spring将会根据类型，访问其他beans进行匹配。\n\n下面的示例显示了如何在ApplicationContext中编写，注册，使用BeanPostProcessor。\nExample: Hello World, BeanPostProcessor-style\n第一个示例演示了基础的使用。示例中演示了一个自定义的BeanPostProcessor实现，在容器创建bean后调用了每个bean的toString()方法，并把结果输出到控制台上。\n以下是自定义BeanPostProcessor实现类的定义：\npackage scripting;\n\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor;\nimport org.springframework.beans.BeansException;\n\npublic class InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {\n\n    // simply return the instantiated bean as-is\n    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean,\n            String beanName) throws BeansException {\n        return bean; // we could potentially return any object reference here...\n    }\n\n    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean,\n            String beanName) throws BeansException {\n        System.out.println(\"Bean ''\" + beanName + \"'' created : \" + bean.toString());\n        return bean;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n注意InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor是简单地定义。它甚至没有名字，因为它能像其它bean一样被依赖注入。（上面示例中也定义了一个使用Groovy脚本支持的bean。Spring动态语言支持详见Chapter 34, Dynamic language support）\n下面简单的Java应用执行了前面代码和配置：\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;\nimport org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;\nimport org.springframework.scripting.Messenger;\n\npublic final class Boot {\n\n    public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {\n        ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"scripting/beans.xml\");\n        Messenger messenger = (Messenger) ctx.getBean(\"messenger\");\n        System.out.println(messenger);\n    }\n\n}\n上面应用运行输出结果如下：\nBean 'messenger' created : org.springframework.scripting.groovy.GroovyMessenger@272961\norg.springframework.scripting.groovy.GroovyMessenger@272961\nExample: The RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor\n自定义BeanPostProcessor实现与回调接口或注解配合使用，是一种常见的扩展Spring IoC容器的手段。一个例子就是RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor-这是一个BeanPostProcessor实现，确保用（任意）注解标记的那些JavaBean属性确实被注入一个值。\n6.8.2 Customizing configuration metadata with a BeanFactoryPostProcessor\n下一个我们要看的扩展点是org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor。这个接口的语义与BeanPostProcessor类似，但有一个主要的不同点：BeanFactoryPostProcessor操作bean的配置元数据；也就是说，Spring的IoC容器允许\nBeanFactoryPostProcessor来读取配置元数据并在容器实例化任何bean(除了BeanFactoryPostProcessor)之前可以修改它。\n你可以配置多个BeanFactoryPostProcessor实例，你可以通过设置order属性来控制这些BeanFactoryPostProcessor执行的顺序。你可以设置这个属性仅当BeanFactoryPostProcessor实现了Ordered接口。如果你编写自己的BeanFactoryPostProcessor你也应该考虑实现Ordered接口。更多细节，请查看BeanPostProcessor和Ordered接口的javadocs。\n\n如果你想修改真实的bean实例（也就是说，从配置元数据中创建的对象），那么你需要使用BeanPostProcessor（在上面 6.8.1 节， “Customizing beans using a BeanPostProcessor”中描述）来代替。在BeanFactoryPostProcessor（ 比 如 使 用\nBeanFactory.getBean()）中来使用这些bean的实例虽然在技术上是可行的，但这么来做会引起bean过早实例化，违反标准的容器生命周期。这也会引发一些副作用，比如绕过bean的后置处理。\nBeanFactoryPostProcessors作用范围是每一个容器。这仅仅和你正在使用容器有关。如果你在一个容器中定义了一个BeanFactoryPostProcessor ，它将仅仅后置处理那个容器中的beans。换言之，一个容器中的beans不会被另一个容器中的BeanFactoryPostProcessor处理，即使这两个容器，具有相同的父类。\n\n当在ApplicationContext中声明时，bean工厂后置处理器会自动被执行，这就可以对定义在容器中的配置元数据进行修改。Spring包含了一些预定义的bean工厂后置处理器，\n比如PropertyOverrideConfigurer和PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer。自定义的BeanFactoryPostProcessor也可以用来，比如，注册自定义的属性编辑器。\nApplicationContext会自动检测任意部署其中，且实现了BeanFactoryPostProcessor接口的bean。在适当的时间，它用这些bean作为bean工厂后置处理器。你可以部署这些后置处理器bean作为你想用的任意其它的bean。\n\n和BeanPostProcessor一样，通常你不会想配置 BeanFactoryPostProcessor来进行延迟初始化。如果没有其它bean引用Bean(Factory)PostProcessor，那么后置处理器就不会被初始化了。因此，标记它为延迟初始化就会被忽略，即便你在元素声明中设置default-lazy-init属性为true，那么Bean(Factory)PostProcessor\n也会正常被初始化。\n\nExample: the Class name substitution PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer\n从使用了标准Java Properties格式的bean定义的分离的文件中，你可以使用PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer来具体化属性值。这么做允许部署应用程序来自定义指定的环境属性，比如数据库的连接URL和密码，不会有修改容器的主XML定义文件或其它文件的复杂性和风险。\n考虑一下下面这个基于 XML 的配置元数据代码片段，这里的 DataSource就使用了占位符来定义。这个示例展示了从Properties文件中配置属性的方法。在运行时，PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer就会用于元数据并为数据源替换一些属性。指定替换的值作为${property-name}形式中的占位符，这里应用了 Ant/log4j/JSP EL 的风格。\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n而真正的值是来自于标准的 Java Properties 格式的文件：\n\njdbc.driverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriverjdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://production:9002jdbc.username=sajdbc.password=root\n\n因此，字符串${jdbc.username}在运行时会被值’sa’替换，对于其它占位符来说也是相同的，匹配到了属性文件中的键就会用其值替换占位符。PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer在bean定义的属性中检查占位符。此外，对占位符可以自定义前缀和后缀。\n使用 Spring 2.5 引入的context命名空间，也可以使用专用的配置元素来配置属性占位符。在location属性中，可以提供一个或多个以逗号分隔的列表。\n\nPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer不仅仅查看在Properties文件中指定的属性。默认情况下，如果它不能在指定的属性文件中找到属性，它也会检查JavaSystem属性。\n你可以通过设置systemPropertiesMode属性，使用下面整数的三者之一来自定义这种行为：\n\nnever(0)：从不检查系统属性\nfallback(1)：如果没有在指定的属性文件中解析到属性，那么就检查系统属性。这是默认的情况。\noverride(2)：在检查指定的属性文件之前，首先去检查系统属性。这就允许系统属性覆盖其它任意的属性资源。\n\n查看PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer的JavaDoc文档来获取更多信息。\n\n你可以使用PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer来替换类名，在运行时，当你不得不去选择一个特定的实现类时，这是很有用的。比如：\n\n\n    \n        classpath:com/foo/strategy.properties\n    \n    \n        custom.strategy.class=com.foo.DefaultStrategy\n    \n\n\n\n如果类在运行时不能解析成一个有效的类，那么在即将创建时，bean 的解析就失败了，这是ApplicationContext在对非延迟初始化bean的preInstantiateSingletons()阶段发生的。\nExample: the PropertyOverrideConfigurer\nPropertyOverrideConfigurer，另外一种bean工厂后置处理器，类似于PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer，但不像后者，对于所有bean的属性，原始定义可以有默认值或没有值。如果一个Properties覆盖文件没有特定bean的属性配置项，那么就会使用默认的上下文定义。\n注意，bean定义是不知道被覆盖的，所以从XML定义文件中不能立即明显反应覆盖配置被使用中。在多个PropertyOverrideConfigurer实例的情况下，为相同 bean 的属性定义不同的值，那么最后一个有效，源于它的覆盖机制。\n属性文件配置行像这种格式：\nbeanName.property=value\n例如：\ndataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\ndataSource.url=jdbc:mysql:mydb\n这个示例文件可以用于包含了dataSource bean的容器，它有driver和url属性。\n复合属性名也是支持的，除了最终的属性被覆盖，只要路径中的每个组件都是非空的（假设由构造方法初始化）。在这个例子中...\nfoo.fred.bob.sammy=123\nfoobean的fred属性的bob属性的sammy属性的值设置为标量123。\n\n指定的覆盖值通常是文字值；它们不会被转换成bean的引用。当XML中的bean定义的原始值指定了 bean 引用时，这个约定也适用。\n\n使用 Spring 2.5 引入的context命名空间，可以使用专用的配置元素来配置属性覆盖：\n\n6.8.3 Customizing instantiation logic with a FactoryBean\n实现了org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean接口的对象是它们自己的工厂。\nFactoryBean接口就是Spring IoC容器实例化逻辑的可插拔点。如果你的初始化代码很复杂，那么相对于（潜在地）大量详细的 XML 而言，最好是使用 Java 语言来表达。你可以创建自己的FactoryBean，在类中编写复杂的初始化代码，之后将你自定义的FactoryBean插入到容器中。\nFactoryBean接口提供下面三个方法：\n\nObject getObject()：返回工厂创建对象的实例。这个实例可能被共享，那就是看这个工厂返回的是单例还是原型实例了。\nboolean isSingleton()：如果 FactoryBean 返回单例的实例，那么该方法返回true，否则就返回false。\nClass getObjectType()：返回由getObject()方法返回的对象类型，或者事先不知道类型时返回null。\n\nFactoryBean的概念和接口被用于 Spring Framework 中的很多地方；随 Spring 发行，有超过50个FactoryBean接口的实现类。\n当你需要向容器请求一个真实的FactoryBean实例，而不是它生产的 bean，调用ApplicationContext的getBean()方法时在bean的id之前加连字符（&）。所以对于一个给定 id 为 myBean的FactoryBean，调用容器的getBean(\"myBean\")方法返回的是FactoryBean的产品；而调用getBean(\"&myBean\")方法则返回FactoryBean实例本身。\n"},"III.

Spring Annotation Programming Model\n6.10.3 Automatically detecting classes and registering bean definitions\nSpring可以自动检测固有的类并在ApplicationContext中注册 对应的BeanDefinition。比如，下面的两个类就是自动检测的例子：\n@Service\npublic class SimpleMovieLister {\n\n    private MovieFinder movieFinder;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public SimpleMovieLister(MovieFinder movieFinder) {\n        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;\n    }\n\n}\n@Repository\npublic class JpaMovieFinder implements MovieFinder {\n    // implementation elided for clarity\n}\n要自动检测这些类并注册对应的 bean，你需要添加@ComponentScan到你的@Configuration类上，其中的base-package元素是这两个类的公共父类包。（你可以任意选择使用逗号/分号/空格分隔的列表来将每个类引入到父包。）\n@Configuration\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"org.example\")\npublic class AppConfig  {\n    ...\n}\n\n为了更简洁，上面的示例可以使用注解的value属性，也就是ComponentScan(\"org.example\")\n\n下面的示例使用XML配置：\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n隐式地开启了功能，当使用了时通常没必要再包含。\n对类路径包的扫描需要类路径下存在对应的目录实体。当你使用 Ant 来构建 JAR 包时，要保证你没有激活 JAR 目标中的 files-only 开关。同时，在一些环境中基于安全策略，类路径下的文件不会被暴露出来，如果单独的apps在JDK 1.7.0_45和更高的版本（这需要‘Trusted-Library’计划在你的manifests中，see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19394570/java-jre-7u45-breaks-classloader-getresources）\n\n此外，当你使用component-scan时，AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor 和\nCommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor二者是隐式包含着的。这就意味着两个组件被自动检测之后就装配在一起了-而不需要在 XML 中提供其它任何 bean 的配置元数据。\n\n你 可 以 将 annotation-config 属 性 置 为 false 来 关 闭AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor和\nCommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor 注册。\n\n6.10.4 Using filters to customize scanning\n默认情况下，使用@Component，@Repository，@Service，@Controller 注解或使用了进行自定义的@Component 注解的类本身仅仅检测候选组件。你可以修改并扩展这种行为，仅仅应用自定义的过滤器就可以了。在 @ComponentScan 注解中添加\ninclude-filter 或 exclude-filter 参数就可以了（或者作为component-scan元素的include-filter 或 exclude-filter 子元素）。每个过滤器元素需要type和expression属性。下面的表格描述了过滤选项。\n表

配置忽略所有@Repository注解并使用“sub”库来替代。\n@Configuration\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"org.example\",\n        includeFilters = @Filter(type = FilterType.REGEX, pattern = \".*Stub.*Repository\"),\n        excludeFilters = @Filter(Repository.class))\npublic class AppConfig {\n    ...\n}\n一样的可以使用XML配置：\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n你可以使用注解的useDefaultFilters=false或元素中的use-default-filter=\"false\"属性来关闭默认的过滤\n器。这会关闭自动检测@Component，@Repository，@Service或@Controller注解的类。\n\n6.10.5 Defining bean metadata within components\nSpring 组件可以为容器提供 bean 定义的元数据。你可以在@Configuration注解的类中使用@Bean注解来达成这一目的。这里有一个简单的示例：\n@Component\npublic class FactoryMethodComponent {\n\n    @Bean\n    @Qualifier(\"public\")\n    public TestBean publicInstance() {\n        return new TestBean(\"publicInstance\");\n    }\n\n    public void doWork() {\n        // Component method implementation omitted\n    }\n\n}\n这个类是个 Spring 组件，它的doWork()方法中包含特定应用代码。同时，它也提供了 bean 的定义并且由工厂方法来指向publicInstance()方法。@Bean注解定义了工厂\n方法和其它 bean 定义的属性，比如通过@Qualifier注解表示的限定符。其它方法级的注解可以使用的是@Scope，@Lazy和自定义限定符注解。\n\n除了组件初始化的角色，@Lazy注解也可以跟着@Autowired或@Inject放置到注入点。在这种上下文中，它将生成一个延迟解析的代理注入。\n\n自动装配字段和方法也是支持的，这在之前讨论过，而且还有对自动装配@Bean方法的支持：\n@Component\npublic class FactoryMethodComponent {\n\n    private static int i;\n\n    @Bean\n    @Qualifier(\"public\")\n    public TestBean publicInstance() {\n        return new TestBean(\"publicInstance\");\n    }\n\n    // use of a custom qualifier and autowiring of method parameters\n\n    @Bean\n    protected TestBean protectedInstance(\n            @Qualifier(\"public\") TestBean spouse,\n            @Value(\"#{privateInstance.age}\") String country) {\n        TestBean tb = new TestBean(\"protectedInstance\", 1);\n        tb.setSpouse(spouse);\n        tb.setCountry(country);\n        return tb;\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_SINGLETON)\n    private TestBean privateInstance() {\n        return new TestBean(\"privateInstance\", i++);\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)\n    public TestBean requestScopedInstance() {\n        return new TestBean(\"requestScopedInstance\", 3);\n    }\n\n}\n这个示例为另外一个名为privateInstance的bean的Age属性自动装配了String方法参数country。Spring 的表达式语言元素通过#{}表示定义了属性的值。对于@Value注解，当解析表达式文本时，表达式解析器会预先配置来查看 bean 的名称。Spring组件中的@Bean方法会被不同方式处理，而不会像Spring的@Configuration类中的同仁那样。不同的是@Component类没有使用 CGLIB 来加强并拦截字段和方法的调用。CGLIB代理是调用@Configuration 类中的@Bean方法或字段来创建 bean 元数据引用协作对象的手段。方法没有使用通常的 Java 语义来调用。相比之下，调用普通的@Component类中的@Bean方法或字段有标准的 Java 语义，没有特殊的CGLIB处理或其他的限制应用。\n\n你可能声明@Bean为static，允许包含它们的配置类没有创建为实例时进行调用。这使得定义后置处理器特别有意义，例如，BeanFactoryPostProcessor 或 BeanPostProcessor，由于这样的bean将在容器生命周期早期初始化，因此应该避免在该点触发配置的其他部分。注意，调用静态的@Bean方法将不会被容器拦截，即使是在@Configuration类里（看上面）。这是由于技术上的局限性：CGLIB 的子类仅仅可以重载非静态的方法。因此，直接调用另一个@Bean方法将会有标准的Java语义，从而直接从工厂方法返回一个独立的实例。在spring容器中，@Bean方法的Java语言可视性并没有直接对bean的定义产生影响。你可以自由地声明你自己的工厂方法填充到非@Configuration类中，也可以是静态方法。当然，在@Configuration类中合格的@Bean方法应该是可重写的，也就是说，你不应该声明为private或final类型。\n最后，@Bean也可以用在给定组件或配置类的基类上，以及Java 8的默认方法声明的被组件或配置类实现的接口。这使得更灵活地组成复杂的配置结构，甚至在Spring 4.2，多重继承可以通过java 8的默认方法实现。\n6.10.6 Naming autodetected components\n当组件被自动检测作为扫描进程的一部分时，它的bean名称是由BeanNameGenerator策略来生成并告知扫描器的。默认情况下，Spring 构造型的注解（@Component，@Repository，@Service 和@Controller）包含name值将会提供该值给对应 bean 定义的名称。\n如果注解不包含name值或任何被检测到的组件（比如那些被自定义过滤器发现的），默认的 bean 的名称生成器返回未大写的非限定符类名。比如，如果下面的两个组件被检测到了，那么名称可能是 myMovieLister 和 movieFinderImpl：\n@Service(\"myMovieLister\")\npublic class SimpleMovieLister {\n    // ...\n}\n@Repository\npublic class MovieFinderImpl implements MovieFinder {\n    // ...\n}\n如果你不想使用默认的 bean 命名策略，你可以提供自定义的 bean 命名策略。首先，实现BeanNameGenerator接口，要保证包含默认的无参构造器。之后，在配置扫描器时，要提供类的完全限定名。\n@Configuration\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"org.example\", nameGenerator = MyNameGenerator.class)\npublic class AppConfig {\n    ...\n}\n\n    \n\n作为通用的规则，要考虑使用注解指定名称时，其它组件可能会有对它的明确的引用。另一方面，当容器负责装配时，自动生成名称是可行的。\n6.10.7 Providing a scope for autodetected components\n一般情况下，Spring 管理的组件，自动检测组件默认和最多使用的作用域是单例。然而，有时你需要其它作用域，Spring 2.5 提供了一个新的@Scope注解。仅仅需要提供作用域的名称到注解上：\n@Scope(\"prototype\")\n@Repository\npublic class MovieFinderImpl implements MovieFinder {\n    // ...\n}\n为作用域提供自定义策略而不是基于注解的方式，实现 ScopeMetadataResolver接口，并保证包含了默认的无参构造方法。之后，当配置扫描器时，要提供类的完全限定名：\n@Configuration\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"org.example\", scopeResolver = MyScopeResolver.class)\npublic class AppConfig {\n    ...\n}\n\n    \n\n当使用确定的非单例作用域时，它可能必须要为该作用域的对象生成代理。这个原因在“Scoped beans as dependencies”章节中描述过了。出于这样的目的，在component-scan元素中可以使用 scoped-proxy 属性。三种可能的值是：no（无），interface（接口）和 targetClass（目标类）。比如，下面的配置就会启动标准的 JDK 动态代理：\n@Configuration\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"org.example\", scopedProxy = ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)\npublic class AppConfig {\n    ...\n}\n\n    \n\n6.10.8 Providing qualifier metadata with annotations\n@Qualifier注解在 “Fine-tuning annotation-based autowiring with qualifiers”章节中讨论过了。那章节中演示了@Qualifier注解的使用和当你需要处理自动装配候选者时，自定义限定符注解来提供细粒度控制。因为那些示例是基于 XML 的 bean 定义的，限定符元数据在候选者 bean 定义中提供，并使用了 XML 中的 bean 元素的 qualifier 和 meta 子元素。\n当对自动检测组件使用基于类路径扫描时，你可以在候选者类中使用类型级别的注解提供限定符元数据。下面的三个示例就展示了这个技术：\n@Component\n@Qualifier(\"Action\")\npublic class ActionMovieCatalog implements MovieCatalog {\n    // ...\n}\n@Component\n@Genre(\"Action\")\npublic class ActionMovieCatalog implements MovieCatalog {\n    // ...\n}\n@Component\n@Offline\npublic class CachingMovieCatalog implements MovieCatalog {\n    // ...\n}\n对于大多数基于注解的方式，要记得注解元数据会绑定到类定义本身中去，而使用 XML就允许对多个相同类型的 bean 在它们的限定符元数据中提供变化，因为那些元数据是对于每个实例而不是每个类提供的。\n\n"},"III.

Core Technologies/Java-based container configuration.html":{"url":"III. Core Technologies/Java-based container configuration.html","title":"基于Java的容器配置","keywords":"","body":"6.12 Java-based container configuration\n6.12.1 Basic concepts: @Bean and @Configuration\nSpring 中新的 Java 配置支持的核心就是@Configuration注解的类和@Bean注解的方法。\n@Bean注解用来指定一个方法实例，配置和初始化一个新对象交给Spring IOC容器管理。对于那些熟悉SpringXML配置的人来说，@Bean注解和元素扮演相同的角色。你可以使用在@Component类中使用@Bean注解方法，但更常用的，是在@Configuration类中使用。\n@Configuration注解的类表示它的主要目的是作为bean定义的来源。另外，@Configuration类允许内部bean依赖通过简单地调用同一类内的其他@Bean方法进行定义。最简单的@Configuration类可能是这样的：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public MyService myService() {\n        return new MyServiceImpl();\n    }\n\n}\n上面AppConfig类与下面Spring XML中的配置是等同的：\n\n    \n\n\nFull @Configuration vs 'lite' @Beans mode?\n当@Bean方法不是在@Configuration中声明时，被称为‘lite’ mode。例如，bean方法在@Component或甚至在简单的PO类中声明，都被认为是’lite‘。与full @Configuration不同的是，lite@Bean方法无法声明内部bean依赖。通常，当在litemode下时一个@Bean方法不应该调用另一个@Bean方法。只有在@Configuration类下使用@Bean方法是被推荐的，确保'full'mode经常使用到。这将阻止被同一个@Bean方法意外地多次调用，帮助减少在litemode下出现的难以追踪的bugs。\n\n@Bean和@Configuration注解将会在下面的章节中被深入地探讨。首先，我们先来看看使用基于 Java 的配置创建 Spring 容器的各种方\n式。\n6.12.2 Instantiating the Spring container using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext\n下面的章节讲解了 Spring 的 AnnotationConfigApplicationContext，是在 Spring3.0 中新加入的。这个全能的ApplicationContext实现类不仅仅可以接受@Configuration类作为输入，也可以是普通的@Component类，还有使用 JSR-330 元数据注解的类。\n当@Configuration类作为输入时，@Configuration类本身作为 bean 被注册了，并且类内所有声明的@Bean方法也被作为 bean 注册了。\n当@Component 和 JSR-330 类作为输入时，它们被注册为 bean，并且被假设如@Autowired 或@Inject 的 DI 元数据在类中需要的地方使用。\n简单构造\n与使用Spring XML配置作为输入实例化ClassPathXmlApplicationContext过程类似，当实例化AnnotationConfigApplicationContext时@Configuration类可能作为输入。这就允许在 Spring 容器中完全可以不使用 XML：\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);\n    MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);\n    myService.doStuff();\n}\n正如上面所提到的，AnnotationConfigApplicationContext不仅仅局限于和@Configuration类合作。任意@Component或 JSR-330 注解的类都可以作为构造方法的输入。比如：\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MyServiceImpl.class, Dependency1.class, Dependency2.class);\n    MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);\n    myService.doStuff();\n}\n上面假设MyServiceImpl，Dependency1和 Dependency2 使用了 Spring 依赖注入注解，比如@Autowired。\n使用 register(Class...)编程式构建容器\nAnnotationConfigApplicationContext可以使用无参构造方法来实例化，之后使用register()方法来配置。这个方法当编程式地构建AnnotationConfigApplicationContext时尤其有用。\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();\n    ctx.register(AppConfig.class, OtherConfig.class);\n    ctx.register(AdditionalConfig.class);\n    ctx.refresh();\n    MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);\n    myService.doStuff();\n}\n使用 scan(String..)开启组件扫描\n要开启组件扫描，仅仅需要在你的@Configuration类上加上如下注解：\n@Configuration\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"com.acme\")\npublic class AppConfig  {\n    ...\n}\n有经验的 Spring 用户肯定会熟悉下面这个 Spring 的 context:命名空间中的常用 XML声明：\n\n    \n\n在上面的示例中，com.acme包会被扫描到，去查找任意@Component注解的类，那些类就会被注册为 Spring 容器中的 bean。AnnotationConfigApplicationContext 暴露出 scan(String ...)方法，允许相同的组件扫描功能：\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();\n    ctx.scan(\"com.acme\");\n    ctx.refresh();\n    MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);\n}\n\n记得@Configuration类是使用@Component进行元数据注解的，所以它们是组件扫描的候选者！在上面的示例中，假设 AppConfig 是声明在 com.acme 包（或是其中的子包）中的，那么会在调用 scan()方法时被找到，在调用 refresh()方法时，所有它的@Bean方法就会被处理并注册为容器中的 bean。\n\n支持Web应用的AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext\nWebApplicationContext 是 AnnotationConfigApplicationContext 的变种，适用于 AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext。当配置 Spring 的 Servlet 监听器ContextLoaderListener，Spring MVC 的 DispatcherServlet 等时，这个实现类就可能被用到了。下面的代码是在 web.xml 中的片段，配置了典型的 Spring MVC 的 Web 应用程序。注意 contextClass 上下文参数和初始化参数的使用：\n\n    \n    \n        contextClass\n        \n            org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n        contextConfigLocation\n        com.acme.AppConfig\n    \n\n    \n    \n        org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener\n    \n\n    \n    \n        dispatcher\n        org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet\n        \n        \n            contextClass\n            \n                org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext\n            \n        \n        \n        \n            contextConfigLocation\n            com.acme.web.MvcConfig\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n        dispatcher\n        /app/*\n    \n\n6.12.3 Using the @Bean annotation\n@Bean是一个方法级的注解，与XML的元素功能相同。该注解支持一些上的属性，如:init-method, destroy-method, autowiring 和 name。\n你可以在@Configuration或@Component类里使用@Bean注解。\n声明一个bean\n要声明一个bean，可以简单地使用@Bean注解到一个方法上。你可以在ApplicationContext容器中使用这个方法的返回值来注册一个bean定义。默认的，bean的名称将会与方法的名称相同。下面是一个@Bean声明的简单示例：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService() {\n        return new TransferServiceImpl();\n    }\n\n}\n上述配置是完全与下面的Spring XML相等的：\n\n    \n\n两者的声明都在ApplicationContext中创建了一个名为transferService的bean，绑定了一个TransferServiceImpl类型的实例对象：\n\ntransferService -> com.acme.TransferServiceImpl\n\nBean依赖\n@Bean注解的方法可以有任意数量的参数依赖来构建bean。比如，如果我们的TransferService要求一个AccountRepository，我们可以具体化该依赖通过一个方法参数：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService(AccountRepository accountRepository) {\n        return new TransferServiceImpl(accountRepository);\n    }\n\n}\n这个解析机制与基于构造器的依赖注入非常相似，详情查看“Constructor-based dependency injection”章节。\n接收生命周期回调\n任何使用@Bean注解定义的类都支持定期的生命周期回调，可以使用 JSR-250 的@PostConstruct和@PreDestroy注解，详情查看6.9.8 @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy\n定期的生命周期回调得到了很好地支持。如果一个bean实现了InitializingBean, DisposableBean, or Lifecycle接口，他们各自的方法将会被容器调用。\n标准的一套*Aware接口，例如，BeanFactoryAware, BeanNameAware, MessageSourceAware, ApplicationContextAware等等，也一样得到了很好的支持。\n@Bean注解支持指定任意的初始化和销毁的回调方法，非常类似于Spring XML中bean元素的init-method和destroy-method属性：\npublic class Foo {\n    public void init() {\n        // initialization logic\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Bar {\n    public void cleanup() {\n        // destruction logic\n    }\n}\n\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean(initMethod = \"init\")\n    public Foo foo() {\n        return new Foo();\n    }\n\n    @Bean(destroyMethod = \"cleanup\")\n    public Bar bar() {\n        return new Bar();\n    }\n}\n默认地，使用Java配置的bean定义有public的close或shutdown方法时，在销毁回调时会被自动地调用。所以如果你有public的close或shutdown方法，而你不想它在容器关闭时被调用，那你可以简单地加上@Bean(destroyMethod=\"\")到你的bean定义上，以此来使默认的(inferred)行为失效。\n你可以想默认地通过JNDI获取你需要的在应用之外管理的资源作为它的生命周期。特别地，一定要始终做一个DataSource，因为它是已知的有问题的：\n@Bean(destroyMethod=\"\")\npublic DataSource dataSource() throws NamingException {\n    return (DataSource) jndiTemplate.lookup(\"MyDS\");\n}\n当然，上面Foo的示例，它等同于在构造期间调用init()方法：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n    @Bean\n    public Foo foo() {\n        Foo foo = new Foo();\n        foo.init();\n        return foo;\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n\n当你完全使用Java配置，你对你的对象可以做任何你想做的，不要总必须依赖于容器的生命周期！\n\n指定bean的作用域\n使用@Scope注解\n你可以指定使用@Bean注解的bean定义应该有个指定的作用域。你可以使用任何在6.5章节 Bean scopes中提到的标准的作用域。\n默认的作用域是singleton，但你可以使用@Scope注解进行覆盖：\n@Configuration\npublic class MyConfiguration {\n\n    @Bean\n    @Scope(\"prototype\")\n    public Encryptor encryptor() {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n}\n@Scope 和 scoped-proxy\nSpring 提供了一个便利的途径，通过作用域代理处理作用域依赖。当使用XML配置时，最简单的方法创建这样一个代理就是使用元素。在Java中使用@Scope注解带proxyMode属性来配置你的beans是等价的。默认的是没有代理（ScopedProxyMode.NO），但你可以指定ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS或ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES。\n// an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy\n@Bean\n@Scope(value = \"session\", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)\npublic UserPreferences userPreferences() {\n    return new UserPreferences();\n}\n\n@Bean\npublic Service userService() {\n    UserService service = new SimpleUserService();\n    // a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean\n    service.setUserPreferences(userPreferences());\n    return service;\n}\n自定义bean命名\n默认地，配置类使用@Bean方法的名称来作为注册bean的名称。这个方法可以被重写，当然，使用的是name属性。\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean(name = \"myFoo\")\n    public Foo foo() {\n        return new Foo();\n    }\n\n}\nBean 混淆现象\n在 6.3.1 , “Naming beans” 章节讨论过，有时需要对单个bean使用多个名称才能满足需要，否则就会有bean混淆现象。@Bean注解的name属性为了达到该目的可以接收一个字符串数组。\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean(name = { \"dataSource\", \"subsystemA-dataSource\", \"subsystemB-dataSource\" })\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        // instantiate, configure and return DataSource bean...\n    }\n\n}\nBean 描述\n有时提供一个更详细的bean的文本描述是很有帮助的。这是特别有用当beans用于（可能通过JMX）监测的目的。\n使用@Description注解来对@Bean添加一个描述：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    @Description(\"Provides a basic example of a bean\")\n    public Foo foo() {\n        return new Foo();\n    }\n\n}\n6.12.4 Using the @Configuration annotation\n@Configuration是一个类级别的注解，用于表明此对象是一个bean定义的资源。@Configuration类通过public的@Bean注解的方法来声明beans。调用@Configuration类的@Bean方法也可以被用于定义inter-bean依赖。详情查看6.12.1, “Basic concepts: @Bean and @Configuration”章节。\nInjecting inter-bean dependencies\n当@Beans上有其它bean的依赖，简单演示一个bean方法调用另一个：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public Foo foo() {\n        return new Foo(bar());\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public Bar bar() {\n        return new Bar();\n    }\n\n}\n在上面的例子中，foobean通过构造器注入接收了一个bar引用。\n\n这个声明inter-bean依赖的方法只会在@Bean声明在@Configuration类下时才会起效。你不能使用简单的@Component类声明inter-bean依赖。\n\n查找方法注入\n如前所述，查找方法注入是一个高级特性，你应该很少会用到。当一个singleton作用域的bean有一个prototype作用域bean的依赖时，这将很有用。对于Java配置，提供了一种自然的方式实现这一模式：\npublic abstract class CommandManager {\n    public Object process(Object commandState) {\n        // grab a new instance of the appropriate Command interface\n        Command command = createCommand();\n\n        // set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance\n        command.setState(commandState);\n    return command.execute();\n    }\n\n    // okay... but where is the implementation of this method?\n    protected abstract Command createCommand();\n}\n使用Java配置支持，你可以创建一个CommandManager的子类，其虚方法createCommand()将会被重写，通过此种方式，来查找一个新的（prototype）的command对象。\n@Bean\n@Scope(\"prototype\")\npublic AsyncCommand asyncCommand() {\n    AsyncCommand command = new AsyncCommand();\n    // inject dependencies here as required\n    return command;\n}\n\n@Bean\npublic CommandManager commandManager() {\n    // return new anonymous implementation of CommandManager with command() overridden\n    // to return a new prototype Command object\n    return new CommandManager() {\n        protected Command createCommand() {\n            return asyncCommand();\n        }\n    }\n}\nFurther information about how Java-based configuration works internally\n下面的例子展示了@Bean注解的方法被调用了2次：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public ClientService clientService1() {\n        ClientServiceImpl clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();\n        clientService.setClientDao(clientDao());\n        return clientService;\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public ClientService clientService2() {\n        ClientServiceImpl clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();\n        clientService.setClientDao(clientDao());\n        return clientService;\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public ClientDao clientDao() {\n        return new ClientDaoImpl();\n    }\n\n}\nclientDao()在clientService1()中被调用一次，在clientService2()也被调用一次。从这个方法创建一个ClientDaoImpl实例并返回它，你通常期望会生成2个实例（每个service一个）。那肯定是有问题的：在Spring中，实例化beans默认拥有一个singleton作用域。这就是神奇的地方：所有的@Configuration类在启动的阶段使用CGLIB进行子类化。在子类中，子方法首先检查容器中任何缓存（scoped）的beans在它调用父方法及创建新的实例之前。注意，Spring3.2已经不再需要添加CGLIB到你的classpath中了，因为CGLIB类已经被打包到org.springframework，并被包含到spring-coreJAR包中了。\n\n根据你的bean的作用域的不同，行为可能会有所不同。我们这里仅谈论了singltons。\n由于CGLIB在启动期间动态添加特性，所以这里有几个限制：\n\n配置类必须不能为final\n应该有一个无参的构造器\n\n\n6.12.5 Composing Java-based configurations\n使用@Import注解\n就像 Spring 的 XML 文件中使用的元素帮助模块化配置一样，@Import注解允许从其它配置类中加载@Bean的配置：\n@Configuration\npublic class ConfigA {\n\n     @Bean\n    public A a() {\n        return new A();\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\n@Import(ConfigA.class)\npublic class ConfigB {\n\n    @Bean\n    public B b() {\n        return new B();\n    }\n\n}\n现在，当实例化上下文时，不需要指定ConfigA.class 和 ConfigB.class 了，仅仅 ConfigB 需要被显式提供：\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ConfigB.class);\n\n    // now both beans A and B will be available...\n    A a = ctx.getBean(A.class);\n    B b = ctx.getBean(B.class);\n}\n这种方式简化了容器的实例化，仅仅是一个类需要被处理，而不是需要开发人员在构造时记住很多大量的@Configuration类。\n在引入的@Bean定义中注入依赖\n上面的示例是可行的，但是太过简单。在很多实际场景中，bean 会有依赖其它配置的类的依赖。当使用 XML 时，这本身不是什么问题，因为没有调用编译器，而且我们可以仅仅声明 ref=\"someBean\"并且相信 Spring 在容器初始化时可以完成。当然，当使用@Configuration的类时，Java 编译器在配置模型上放置约束，对其它 bean 的引用必须是符合 Java 语法的。\n幸运的是，解决这个问题非常简单。我们已经讨论过了，@Bean方法可以有任意个参数声明bean依赖。让我们考虑一个更真实的场景，有个@Configuration类，每个bean都依赖其他的配置中声明的bean：\n@Configuration\npublic class ServiceConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService(AccountRepository accountRepository) {\n        return new TransferServiceImpl(accountRepository);\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\npublic class RepositoryConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public AccountRepository accountRepository(DataSource dataSource) {\n        return new JdbcAccountRepository(dataSource);\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\n@Import({ServiceConfig.class, RepositoryConfig.class})\npublic class SystemTestConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        // return new DataSource\n    }\n\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SystemTestConfig.class);\n    // everything wires up across configuration classes...\n    TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);\n    transferService.transfer(100.00, \"A123\", \"C456\");\n}\n有另外一种方法可以达到一样的结果。记住@Configuration类最终是容器中的另外一个bean：也就是说它们可以像其它 bean 那样利用@Autowired注入元数据！\n\n要确定这种方式的依赖注入是最简单的那种。@Configuration类在容器初始化时就进行处理了，强制要求依赖使用这种方式进行注入可能导致意外的早期初始化问题。如果可能，就采用如上述例子所示的基于参数的注入。\n同时，也要特别小心通过@Bean的BeanPostProcessor BeanFactoryPostProcessor定义。它们应该被声明为static的@Bean方法，不会触发实例化它们的包含类。否则，@Autowired和@Value将在配置类上不生效，因为它太早被创建为一个实例了。\n\n@Configuration\npublic class ServiceConfig {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private AccountRepository accountRepository;\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService() {\n        return new TransferServiceImpl(accountRepository);\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\npublic class RepositoryConfig {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n\n    @Bean\n    public AccountRepository accountRepository() {\n        return new JdbcAccountRepository(dataSource);\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\n@Import({ServiceConfig.class, RepositoryConfig.class})\npublic class SystemTestConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        // return new DataSource\n    }\n\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SystemTestConfig.class);\n    // everything wires up across configuration classes...\n    TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);\n    transferService.transfer(100.00, \"A123\", \"C456\");\n}\n在上面的场景中，使用@Autowired工作正常，提供所需的模块化，但是准确地决定在哪儿声明自动装配的 bean 还是有些含糊。比如，作为开发者来看待 ServiceConfig，你如何准确知道@Autowired AccountRepository 在哪里声明的？它没有显式地出现在代码中，这可能很不错。要记得 SpringSource Tool Suite 提供工具可以生成展示所有对象是如何装配起来的-那可能就是你所需要的。而且，你的 Java IDE 可以很容器发现所有的声明，还有使用的 AccountRepository 类型，也会很快地给你展示出@Bean方法的位置和返回的类型。\n在这种歧义不能接受，你想直接在 IDE 中从一个@Configuration 类导航到另一个，要考虑自动装配配置类的本身：\n@Configuration\npublic class ServiceConfig {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private RepositoryConfig repositoryConfig;\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService() {\n        // navigate 'through' the config class to the @Bean method!\n        return new TransferServiceImpl(repositoryConfig.accountRepository());\n    }\n\n}\n在上面的情形中，定义AccountRepository是完全明确的。而ServiceConfig却紧紧耦合到RepositoryConfig中了；这就需要我们来权衡了。这种紧耦合可以使用基于接口或抽象基类的@Configuration类来减轻。考虑下面的代码：\n@Configuration\npublic class ServiceConfig {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private RepositoryConfig repositoryConfig;\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService() {\n        return new TransferServiceImpl(repositoryConfig.accountRepository());\n    }\n}\n\n@Configuration\npublic interface RepositoryConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    AccountRepository accountRepository();\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\npublic class DefaultRepositoryConfig implements RepositoryConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public AccountRepository accountRepository() {\n        return new JdbcAccountRepository(...);\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Configuration\n@Import({ServiceConfig.class, DefaultRepositoryConfig.class}) // import the concrete config!\npublic class SystemTestConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        // return DataSource\n    }\n\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SystemTestConfig.class);\n    TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);\n    transferService.transfer(100.00, \"A123\", \"C456\");\n}\n现在ServiceConfig 和 DefaultRepositoryConfig 的耦合就比较松了，并且内建的 IDE 工具也一直有效：对于开发人员来说会更加简单地获取 RepositoryConfig 实现类的类型层次。以这种方式，导航@Configuration 类和它们的依赖就和普通的基于接口代码的导航过程没有任何区别了。\nConditionally include @Configuration classes or @Bean methods\n基于任意的系统状态，使完整的@Configuration类或单独的@Bean方法有条件性地生效或失效是很有用的。一个常见的例子就是当一个指定的profile已经在Spring环境中生效时使用@Profile注解来激活beans（详见Section 6.13.1, “Bean definition profiles”）。\n@Profile注解是通过使用一个非常灵活的称为@Conditional的注解实现的。@Conditional注解表示具体的org.springframework.context.annotation.Condition实现者应该在@Bean被注册前先被访问。\nCondition接口的实现简单地提供了一个matches(…​)方法，用来返回true或false。例如，以下就是使用@Profile具体的Condition实现：\n@Override\npublic boolean matches(ConditionContext context, AnnotatedTypeMetadata metadata) {\n    if (context.getEnvironment() != null) {\n        // Read the @Profile annotation attributes\n        MultiValueMap attrs = metadata.getAllAnnotationAttributes(Profile.class.getName());\n        if (attrs != null) {\n            for (Object value : attrs.get(\"value\")) {\n                if (context.getEnvironment().acceptsProfiles(((String[]) value))) {\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n结合 Java和 和 XML\nSpring 的@Configuration类并不是完全100%地支持 Spring XML 替换的。一些基本特性，比如 Spring XML 的命名空间会保持在一个理想的方式下去配置容器。在 XML 更便于使用或是必须要使用的情况下，你也有另外一个选择：以“XML为中心”的方式来实例化容器，比如，ClassPathXmlApplicationContext，或者以“Java 为中心”的方式，使用AnnotationConfigurationApplicationContext 和@ImportResource注解来引入需要的 XML。\n以“XML为中心”使用@Configuration\n以XML配置文件结合包含@Configuration类的点对点的方式来启动 Spring 容器是更好的选择。比如，在使用了 Spring XML配置的大型的代码库中，根据需要从已有的 XML 文件中创建@Configuration类是很简单的。在下面，你会发现在这种“XML为中心”情形下，使用@Configuration 类的选项。\n记住，@Configuration类最终仅仅是容器中的bean。在这个示例中，我们创建了名为AppConfig的@Configuration类，并且将它包含在 system-test-config.xml文件中作为的定义。因为开启了配置，容器会识别@Configuration注解，并以合适的方式处理声明在AppConfig中@Bean方法。\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n\n    @Bean\n    public AccountRepository accountRepository() {\n        return new JdbcAccountRepository(dataSource);\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public TransferService transferService() {\n        return new TransferService(accountRepository());\n    }\n\n}\nsystem-test-config.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\njdbc.properties:jdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/xdbjdbc.username=sajdbc.password=   \n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"classpath:/com/acme/system-test-config.xml\");\n    TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);\n    // ...\n}\n\n在上面的system-test-config.xml文件中，AppConfig的定义没有声明id元素。这么做也是可以接受的，就不必让其它 bean 去引用它了，同时也就不可能从容器中通过明确的名称来获取它了。同样地，DataSourcebean，通过类型自动装配，那么明确的 beanid就不严格要求了。\n\n因为@Configuration是使用@Component来元数据注解的，被@Configuration注解的类是自动作为组件扫描的候选者的。使用上面相同的场景，我们可以重新来定义system-test-config.xml文件来利用组件扫描的优点。注意这种情况下，我们不需要明确地声明，因为开启了相同的功能。\nsystem-test-config.xml:\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n使用了@ImportResource导入XML的@Configuration类为中心\n在@Configuration类作为配置容器主要机制的应用程序中，使用一些 XML 还是必要的。在这些情况中，仅仅使用@ImportResource来定义 XML 就可以了。这么来做就实现了“Java为中心”的方式来配置容器并保持 XML 在最低限度。\n@Configuration\n@ImportResource(\"classpath:/com/acme/properties-config.xml\")\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Value(\"${jdbc.url}\")\n    private String url;\n\n    @Value(\"${jdbc.username}\")\n    private String username;\n\n    @Value(\"${jdbc.password}\")\n    private String password;\n\n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        return new DriverManagerDataSource(url, username, password);\n    }\n\n}\nproperties-config.xml\n\n    \n\n\njdbc.propertiesjdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/xdbjdbc.username=sajdbc.password=  \npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);\n    TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);\n    // ...\n}\n\n"},"III. Core Technologies/Environment abstraction.html":{"url":"III. Core Technologies/Environment abstraction.html","title":"环境的抽象","keywords":"","body":"环境的抽象\nEnvironment是一个集成到容器之中的特殊抽象，它针对应用的环境建立了两个关键的概念：profile和properties.\nprofile是命名好的，其中包含了多个Bean的定义的一个逻辑集合，只有当指定的profile被激活的时候，其中的Bean才会激活。无论是通过XML定义的还是通过注解解析的Bean都可以配置到profile之中。而Environment对象的角色就是跟profile相关联，然后决定来激活哪一个profile，还有哪一个profile为默认的profile。\nproperties在几乎所有的应用当中都有着重要的作用，当然也可能存在多个数据源：property文件，JVM系统property，系统环境变量，JNDI，servlet上下文参数，ad-hoc属性对象，Map等。Environment对象和property相关联，然后来给开发者一个方便的服务接口来配置这些数据源，并正确解析。\nBean定义的profile\n在容器之中，Bean定义profile是一种允许不同环境注册不同bean的机制。环境的概念就意味着不同的Bean对应不同的开发者，而且这个特性在以下场景使用十分便利：\n\n解决一些内存中的数据源的问题，可以在不同环境访问不同的数据源，开发环境，QA测试环境，生产环境等。\n仅仅在开发环境来使用一些监视服务\n在不同的环境，使用不同的bean实现\n\n下面参考一个例子，下面的应用需要一个DataSource，在一个测试的环境下，可能类似如下代码：\n@Bean\npublic DataSource dataSource() {\n    return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()\n        .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)\n        .addScript(\"my-schema.sql\")\n        .addScript(\"my-test-data.sql\")\n        .build();\n}\n现在考虑如果应用部署到QA环境或者生产环境，假设应用的数据源是服务器上的JNDI目录的话，我们的DataSource可能会如下：\n@Bean(destroyMethod=\"\")\npublic DataSource dataSource() throws Exception {\n    Context ctx = new InitialContext();\n    return (DataSource) ctx.lookup(\"java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource\");\n}\n问题就是如何基于当前的环境来使用不同的配置。在以前，Spring的开发者开发了很多的方法来解决这个问题，通常都依赖于系统环境变量和XML中的标签以及占位符${placeholder}等来根据不同的环境解析当前的配置文件。现在Bean的profile属于容器的特性，也是该问题的解决方案之一。\n如果我们泛化了我们一些特殊环境下引用的bean定义，我们可以将其中指定的Bean注入到特定的context之中，而不是所有的context之中了。很多开发者就希望能够在一种环境下使用Bean定义A，另一种情况下使用Bean定义B。\n@Profile注解\n@Profile注解允许开发者来表示一个组件是否适合在当前环境来进行注册，只有当前的Profile是激活的时候，对应的Bean才会被注册到上下文中。使用前面的例子，代码可以进行如下调整:\n@Configuration\n@Profile(\"dev\")\npublic class StandaloneDataConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()\n            .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)\n            .addScript(\"classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql\")\n            .addScript(\"classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql\")\n            .build();\n    }\n}\n@Configuration\n@Profile(\"production\")\npublic class JndiDataConfig {\n\n    @Bean(destroyMethod=\"\")\n    public DataSource dataSource() throws Exception {\n        Context ctx = new InitialContext();\n        return (DataSource) ctx.lookup(\"java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource\");\n    }\n}\n@Profile注解可以当做元注解来使用。比如，下面所定义的@Production注解就可以来替代@Profile(\"production\"):\n@Target(ElementType.TYPE)\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n@Profile(\"production\")\npublic @interface Production {\n}\n@Profile注解也可以在方法级别使用，可以声明在包含@Bean注解的方法之上：\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    @Profile(\"dev\")\n    public DataSource devDataSource() {\n        return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()\n            .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)\n            .addScript(\"classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql\")\n            .addScript(\"classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql\")\n            .build();\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    @Profile(\"production\")\n    public DataSource productionDataSource() throws Exception {\n        Context ctx = new InitialContext();\n        return (DataSource) ctx.lookup(\"java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource\");\n    }\n}\n\n如果配置了@Configuration的类同时配置了@Profile，那么所有的配置了@Bean注解的方法和@Import注解的相关的类都会被传递为该Profile。除非这个Profile激活了，否则其中的Bean定义都不会激活。如果配置为@Component或者@Configuration的类标记了@Profile({\"p1\", \"p2\"}),那么这个类当且仅当Profile是p1或者p2的时候才会激活。如果某个Profile的前缀是!这个非操作符，那么@Profile注解的类会只有当前的Profile没有激活的时候才能生效。举例来说，如果配置为@Profile({\"p1\", \"!p2\"})，那么注册的行为会在Profile为p1或者是Profile为非p2的时候才会激活。\n\nXML中Bean定义的profile\n在XML中相对应配置是中的profile属性。我们在前面配置的信息可以被重写到XML文件之中如下：\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n当然，也可以通过嵌套标签来完成定义部分：\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\nspring-bean.xsd已经被定义好，可以使用上面例子之中的这类标签。这将为XML文件的配置提供更多便利。\n激活profile\n现在，我们已经更新了配置信息来使用环境抽象，但是我们还需要告诉Spring来激活具体哪一个Profile。如果我们直接启动应用的话，现在就回抛出NoSuchBeanDefinitionException异常，因为容器会找不到Spring的BeandataSource。\n有多种方法来激活一个Profile，最直接的方式就是通过编程的方式来直接调用EnvironmentAPI，ApplicationContext中包含这个接口：\nAnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();\nctx.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles(\"dev\");\nctx.register(SomeConfig.class, StandaloneDataConfig.class, JndiDataConfig.class);\nctx.refresh();\n额外的，Profile还可以通过spring.profiles.active中的属性来指定，可以通过系统环境变量，JVM系统变量，servlet上下文中的参数,甚至是JNDI的一个参数等来写入。在集成测试中，激活Profile可以通过spring-test中的@ActiveProfiles来实现。\n需要注意的是，Profile的定义并不是一种互斥的关系，我们完全可以在同一时间激活多个Profile的。编程上来说，为setActiveProfile()方法提供多个Profile的名字即可：\nctx.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles(\"profile1\", \"profile2\");\n也可以通过spring.profiles.active来指定，逗号分隔的多个Profile的名字：\n-Dspring.profiles.active=\"profile1,profile2\"\n默认profile\n默认的Profile就表示默认启用的Profile。参考如下代码：\n@Configuration\n@Profile(\"default\")\npublic class DefaultDataConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n        return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()\n            .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)\n            .addScript(\"classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql\")\n            .build();\n    }\n}\n如果没有其他的Profile被激活，那么上面代码定义的dataSource就会被创建，这种方式就是为默认情况下提供Bean定义的一种方式。一旦任何一个Profile激活了，默认的Profile则不会激活。\n默认的Profile的名字可以通过Environment中的setDefaultProfiles()方法或者是通过spring.profiles.default属性来更改。\n属性源抽象\nSpring的Environment的抽象提供了一些层次化的搜索选项，来配置的源信息。具体的内容，参考如下代码：\nApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext();\nEnvironment env = ctx.getEnvironment();\nboolean containsFoo = env.containsProperty(\"foo\");\nSystem.out.println(\"Does my environment contain the 'foo' property? \" + containsFoo);\n在上面的代码片段之中，我们看到一个high-level的查找Spring是否定义foo属性的一种方式。为了知道Spring中是否包含这个属性，Environment对象会针对PropertySource的集合进行查找。PropertySource是针对一些key-value的属性对的简单抽象，而Spring的StandardEnvironment是由两个PropertySource对象所组成的，一个代表的是JVM的系统属性（可以通过System.getProperties()来获取），而另一种则是系统的环境变量（通过System.getenv()来获取。）\n\n这些默认的属性源都是StandardEnvironment的代表，在任何应用之中都可以使用。StandardServletEnvironment则是包含Servlet配置的环境信息，其中会包含很多Servlet的配置和Servlet上下文参数。StandardPortletEnvironment类似于StandardServletEnvironment，能够配置portlet上下文参数。可以参考其Javadoc了解更多信息。\n\n具体的说，当使用StandardEnvironment的时候，调用env.containsProperty(\"foo\")将返回一个foo的系统属性，或者是foo的运行时环境变量。\n\n查询配置属性是按层次来查询的。默认情况下，系统属性优于系统环境变量，所以如果foo属性在两个环境中都有配置的话，那么在调用env.getProperty(\"foo\")期间，系统属性值会优先返回。需要注意的是，属性的值是不会合并的，而是完全覆盖掉。\n在一个普通的StandardServletEnvironment之中，查找的顺序如下，优先查找* ServletConfig参数（比如DispatcherServlet上下文），然后是* ServletContext参数（web.xml中的上下文参数），再然后是* JNDI环境变量，JVM系统变量（\"-D\"命令行参数）以及JVM环境变量（操作系统环境变量）。\n\n最重要的是，整个的查找机制是可以配置的。也许开发者自己有些定义的配置源信息想集成到配置检索的系统中去。没问题，只要实现开发者自己的PropertySource并且将其加入到当前Environment的PropertySources之中即可：\nConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext();\nMutablePropertySources sources = ctx.getEnvironment().getPropertySources();\nsources.addFirst(new MyPropertySource());\n在上面的代码之中，MyPropertySource被添加到检索配置的第一优先级之中。如果存在一个foo属性，它将由于其他的PropertySource之中的foo属性优先返回。MutablePropertySourcesAPI提供一些方法来允许精确控制配置源。\n@PropertySource注解\n@PropertySource注解提供了一种方便的机制来将PropertySource增加到Spring的Environment之中。\n给定一个文件app.properties包含了key-value对testbean.name=myTestBean,下面的代码中，使用了@PropertySource调用testBean.getName()将返回myTestBean:\n@Configuration\n@PropertySource(\"classpath:/com/myco/app.properties\")\npublic class AppConfig {\n    @Autowired\n    Environment env;\n\n    @Bean\n    public TestBean testBean() {\n        TestBean testBean = new TestBean();\n        testBean.setName(env.getProperty(\"testbean.name\"));\n        return testBean;\n    }\n}\n任何的@PropertySource之中形如${...}的占位符，都可以被解析成Environment中的属性资源，比如:\n@Configuration\n@PropertySource(\"classpath:/com/${my.placeholder:default/path}/app.properties\")\npublic class AppConfig {\n    @Autowired\n    Environment env;\n\n    @Bean\n    public TestBean testBean() {\n        TestBean testBean = new TestBean();\n        testBean.setName(env.getProperty(\"testbean.name\"));\n        return testBean;\n    }\n}\n假设上面的my.placeholder是我们已经注册到Environment之中的资源，举例来说，JVM系统属性或者是环境变量的话，占位符会解析成对象的值。如果没有的话，default/path会来作为默认值。如果没有指定默认值，而且占位符也解析不出来的话，就会抛出IllegalArgumentException。\n占位符解析\n从历史上来说，占位符的值是只能针对JVM系统属性或者环境变量来解析的。但是现在不是了，因为环境抽象已经继承到了容器之中，现在很容易通过容器将占位符解析集成。这意味着开发者可以任意的配置占位符：\n\n开发者可以自由调整系统变量还有环境变量的优先级\n开发者可以额外增加自己的属性源信息\n\n具体的说，下面的XML配置不会在意customer属性在哪里定义，只有这个值在Environment之中有效即可：\n\n    \n\n"},"III.

Spring AOP APIs 将讨论 Spring 1.2 API 所提供的底层的 AOP 支持。\nSpring中所使用的AOP：\n\n提供声明式企业服务，特别是为了替代 EJB 声明式服务。最重要的服务是 declarative transaction management（声明性事务管理）， 这个服务建立在Spring的抽象事务管理（transaction abstraction）之上。\n允许用户实现自定义的切面，用 AOP 来完善 OOP 的使用。\n\n如果你只打算使用通用的声明式服务或者预先打包的声明式中间件服务，例如 pooling（缓冲池），你可以不直接使用 AOP ，可以忽略本章大部分内容\n9.1.1 AOP concepts 概念\n首先让我们从定义一些重要的 AOP 概念开始。这些术语不是 Spring 特有的。 不幸的是，Spring 术语并不是特别的直观；如果 Spring 使用自己的术语，将会变得更加令人困惑。\n\nAspect（切面）： 一个关注点的模块化，这个关注点可能会横切多个对象。事务管理是 企业级 Java 应用中一个关于横切关注点的很好的例子。 在 Spring AOP 中，切面可以使用通用类（ schema-based基于模式的风格） 或者在普通类中以 @Aspect 注解（@AspectJ 注解样式）来实现。\nJoin point (连接点）： 在程序执行过程中某个特定的点，比如某方法调用的时候或者处理异常的时候。 在 Spring AOP 中，一个连接点 总是 代表一个方法的执行。 \nAdvice（通知）： 在切面的某个特定的 join point（连接点）上执行的动作。通知有各种类型，其中包括“around”、“before”和“after”等通知。 通知的类型将在后面部分进行讨论。许多 AOP 框架，包括 Spring，都是以拦截器做通知模型，并维护一个以连接点为中心的拦截器链。\nPointcut（切入点）： 匹配 join point（连接点）的断言。通知和一个切入点表达式关联，并在满足这个切入点的连接点上运行（例如，当执行某个特定名称的方法时）。 切入点表达式如何和连接点匹配是 AOP 的核心：Spring 默认使用 AspectJ 切入点语法。\nIntroduction（引入）： 声明额外的方法或者某个类型的字段。 Spring 允许引入新的接口（以及一个对应的实现）到任何被 advise（通知）的对象。 例如，你可以使用一个引入来使 bean 实现 IsModified 接口，以便简化缓存机制。（在 AspectJ  社区 ，Introduction也被称为 inter-type declaration（内部类型声明））\nTarget object（目标对象）： 被一个或者多个 aspect（切面）所advise（通知）的对象。也有人把它叫做 advised （被通知） 对象。 既然 Spring AOP 是通过运行时代理实现的，这个对象永远是一个 proxied（被代理） 对象。\nAOP proxy（AOP代理）： AOP 框架创建的对象，用来实现 aspect contract（切面契约）（包括通知方法执行等功能）。 在 Spring 中，AOP 代理可以是 JDK 动态代理或者 CGLIB 代理。\nWeaving（织入）： 把 aspect（切面）连接到其它的应用程序类型或者对象上，并创建一个被 advised （被通知）的对象。 这些可以在编译时（例如使用 AspectJ 编译器），类加载时和运行时完成。 Spring 和其他纯 Java AOP 框架一样，在运行时完成织入。\n\n通知的类型：\n\nBefore advice（前置通知）： 在某 join point（连接点）之前执行的通知，但这个通知不能阻止连接点前的执行（除非它抛出一个异常）。\nAfter returning advice（返回后通知）： 在某 join point（连接点）正常完成后执行的通知：例如，一个方法没有抛出任何异常，正常返回。\nAfter throwing advice（抛出异常后通知）： 在方法抛出异常退出时执行的通知。\nAfter (finally) advice（最后通知）： 当某join point（连接点）退出的时候执行的通知（不论是正常返回还是异常退出）。\n环绕通知（Around Advice）： 包围一个join point（连接点）的通知，如方法调用。这是最强大的一种通知类型。 环绕通知可以在方法调用前后完成自定义的行为。它也会选择是否继续执行连接点或直接返回它们自己的返回值或抛出异常来结束执行。\n\n环绕通知是最常用的一种通知类型。跟 AspectJ 一样，Spring 提供所有类型的通知，我们推荐你使用尽量简单的通知类型来实现需要的功能。 例如，如果你只是需要用一个方法的返回值来更新缓存，虽然使用环绕通知也能完成同样的事情， 但是你最好使用 After returning 通知而不是环绕通知。 用最合适的通知类型可以使得编程模型变得简单，并且能够避免很多潜在的错误。 比如，你不需要调用 JoinPoint（用于Around Advice）的 proceed() 方法，就不会有调用的问题。\n在Spring 2.0中，所有的通知参数都是静态类型，因此你可以使用合适的类型（例如一个方法执行后的返回值类型）作为通知的参数而不是使用一个对象数组。\npointcut（切入点）和 join point（连接点）匹配的概念是 AOP 的关键，这使得 AOP 不同于其它仅仅提供拦截功能的旧技术。 切入点使得  advice （通知）可独立于 OO 层次。 例如，一个提供声明式事务管理的around 通知可以被应用到一组横跨多个对象中的方法上（例如服务层的所有业务操作）。\n9.1.2 Spring AOP capabilities and goals 功能和目标\nSpring AOP 用纯 Java 实现。它不需要专门的编译过程。Spring AOP 不需要控制类装载器层次，因此它适用于 Servlet 容器或应用服务器。\nSpring 目前仅支持使用方法调用作为join point（连接点）（在 Spring bean 上通知方法的执行）。 虽然可以在不影响到 Spring AOP核心 API 的情况下加入对成员变量拦截器支持，但 Spring 并没有实现成员变量拦截器。 如果你需要通知对成员变量的访问和更新连接点，可以考虑其它语言，例如 AspectJ。\nSpring 实现 AOP 的方法跟其他的框架不同。Spring 并不是要尝试提供最完整的 AOP 实现（尽管 Spring AOP 有这个能力）， 相反的，它其实侧重于提供一种 AOP 实现和 Spring IoC 容器的整合，用于帮助解决在企业级开发中的常见问题。\n因此，Spring AOP 通常都和 Spring IoC 容器一起使用。 Aspect 使用普通的bean 定义语法（尽管 Spring 提供了强大的“autoproxying（自动代理）”功能）： 与其他 AOP 实现相比这是一个显著的区别。有些事使用 Spring AOP 是无法轻松或者高效的完成的，比如说通知一个细粒度的对象。 这种时候，使用 AspectJ 是最好的选择。不过经验告诉我们： 于大多数在企业级 Java 应用中遇到的问题，只要适合 AOP 来解决的，Spring AOP 都没有问题，Spring AOP 提供了一个非常好的解决方案。\nSpring AOP 从来没有打算通过提供一种全面的 AOP 解决方案来取代AspectJ。 我们相信无论是 proxy-based（基于代理 ）的框架比如说Spring AOP 亦或是 full-blown 的框架比如说是 AspectJ 都是很有价值的，他们之间的关系应该是互补而不是竞争的关系。 Spring 可以无缝的整合 Spring AOP，IoC 和 AspectJ，使得所有的 AOP 应用完全融入基于 Spring 的应用体系。 这样的集成不会影响 Spring AOP API 或者AOP Alliance API；Spring AOP保留了向下兼容性。下一章 10. Spring AOP APIs会详细讨论 Spring AOP API。\n一个 Spring Framework 的核心原则是 non-invasiveness(非侵袭性)；这意味着你不应该在您的业务/域模型被迫引入框架特定的类和接口。然而，在一些地方，Spring Framework 可以让你选择引入 Spring Framework 特定的依赖关系到你的代码，给你这样选择的理由是因为在某些情况下它可能是更容易读或编写一些特定功能。Spring Framework （几乎）总是给你的选择：你可以自由的做出明智的决定，选择最适合您的特定用例或场景。\n这样的选择与本章有关的是 AOP 框架（和 AOP 类型）选择。你可以选择AspectJ 和/或 Spring AOP ，你也可以选择 @AspectJ 注解式的方法或Spring 的 XML 配置方式。事实上，本章以介绍 @AspectJ 风格为先不应该被视为 Spring 团队倾向于 @AspectJ 的方法胜过在 Spring 的XML 配置方式。\n见9.4. Choosing which AOP declaration style to use里面有更完整的每种风格的使用原因探讨。\n9.1.3 AOP Proxies 代理\nSpring缺省使用标准 JDK dynamic proxies（动态代理）来作为AOP的代理。这样任何接口（或者接口的 set）都可以被代理。\nSpring 也支持使用 CGLIB 代理. 对于需要代理类而不是代理接口的时候CGLIB 代理是很有必要的。 如果一个业务对象并没有实现一个接口，默认就会使用 CGLIB。 此外，面向接口编程 也是一个最佳实践，业务对象通常都会实现一个或多个接口。此外，还可以强制的使用 CGLIB，在那些（希望是罕见的）在你需要通知一个未在接口中声明的方法的情况下，或者当你需要传递一个代理对象作为一种具体类型到方法的情况下。\n一个重要的事实是，Spring AOP 是  proxy-based (基于代理)。见第9.6.1，“理解 AOP 代理”理解这个含义\n"},"III.
